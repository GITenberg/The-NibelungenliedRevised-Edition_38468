<p>The "Nibelungenlied," as the great national epic of Germany, is not only
one of the most important literary monuments that the German mind has
produced in all periods of its history, but, in reality beyond this, it
is also in its matter and its manner one of the world's great classics.
It is this inherently because of the universal intelligibility of its
story, for the broad human sympathy which must be felt with its
characters and their motives of action, and for the sustained poetic
treatment of the whole in the long poem. In all these respects the
"Nibelungenlied," although German in its spirit and its environment,
rises inevitably above the confines of nationality, and becomes, like
other works that are in a true sense great, by virtue of its
universality an integral part of that cosmopolitan body that we call the
literature of the world.</p>

<p>Like the "Iliad," or any other popular epic whatever, the
"Nibelungenlied" is, however, first and foremost a picture of the
national life and the national soul. Its characters in this way are,
consequently, both fundamentally and of necessity a part of their own
special environment into which each, according to his individuality,
fits; and the manners and customs, the religion and ethics, are first of
all essentially German in order to embody them and to motive their
actions to the public for which the poem was originally intended. What
we are given in the "Nibelungenlied" is primarily then, at least in its
exterior, a picture of German life in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. The customs are those of the courts and castles of the place
and time, the men and women are the knights and ladies who inhabit them;
and if the real mainsprings of motive and action sometimes go back
beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">iv</a></span> poet's own day and generation for reasons that shall
presently be told, the thoughts and feelings of the characters under his
hand betray on the surface no trace of it.</p>

<p>To an English reader there is astonishingly little in the
"Nibelungenlied" in motive that is unintelligible or hopelessly remote.
It is not that its manners of thought are our manners of thought, or its
ethics our ethics. Its deeds, since the real story is an ancient
inheritance, are tragic with battle, murder, and sudden death; but, in
spite of all this, there is in us an innate appreciation of it and of
its spirit that it is utterly impossible to feel in much literature that
is not our own. This of course arises from the fact that it is, in a
sense, our own, as, in part, at the beginning in very truth it was. The
difference in its whole environment from us is still, in reality, not
great, and we realize, consciously or unconsciously, that it is in many
ways our own ancient past that is chronicled in the German poem.</p>

<p>For all these reasons it comes readily about that, in the light of the
poet's master touch, the characters of the "Nibelungenlied" that he has
left in such actuality in his verses are to us neither vague nor
shadowy, but are real persons who live and act before us. This is in
fact truer of the "Nibelungenlied" than of almost any other great poem
of the kind, whatever its time and place of origin. Siegfried and
Kriemhild, Hagen and Rudeger are not the mere creations and
impersonations of a poet's imagination; they are to us real men and
women who lived their lives and died their deaths as the poet has
described them. That he has told his tale with wonderful literary skill
as a whole and at times with marvellous appreciation of the value of the
moment, is also to be stated. Because no doubt in part from the way in
which the poem has come down to us, there is at times superfluous
material that had better been left away, but in this fact, too, the poem
differs but little from other popular epics.</p>

<p>As a whole, the "Nibelungenlied" is characterized by a literary unity of
treatment by no means inconsiderable, and greater, in point of fact,
than its origin would ordinarily promise. Its unity, however, is
dramatic, rather than epic in the ordinary sense. This character it
never loses throughout the whole long action. Deed follows deed, stroke
upon stroke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">v</a></span> until the final catastrophe is inevitably reached and the
story is ended.</p>

<p>That this story in its origin is not narrowly German, but is Germanic
property, should be borne in mind by its reader, since many of its
episodes acquire thereby a broader significance, and the whole poem
assumes a wider interest.</p>

<p>The earliest versions of the story of the Volsungs and Nibelungs, the
Germanic "tale of Troy," that have come down to us are not from German
territory, but from the Scandinavian North, although here, too, the
scene of the principal action is on the Rhine and in the land of the
Huns, which is vaguely conceived to be a part of the German country.
Sigmund, the father of Sigurd, is a King in the land of the Franks;
Sigurd is slain to the south of the Rhine, and in the Rhine is forever
hidden the fateful hoard of the Nibelungs. The story in reality wandered
out twice into the North from its original home in Germany: once
apparently in the Viking age when the Northmen for the first time came
into close contact with the other Germanic people on the continent and
in the British Islands, a period long antecedent to the
"Nibelungenlied;" and again five hundred years later, after the German
poem had arisen, since it can be readily shown that this has been used
as a source of a part of the material.</p>

<p>The very first of these Northern versions is that contained in the
"Elder Edda," a collection of mythological and legendary poems in the
Old Norse language, of unknown authorship, whose time and place of
origin are alike matters of varying supposition. The subject was the
theme of poets for centuries in the North. The oldest of the poems in
the "Edda" that has to do with the story of the "Nibelungenlied," from
internal evidence, was made as early as the year 900; the latest is from
a time not far from 1200. These poems and fragments of poems, some of
them even in prose rescript and most of them interspersed here and there
with bits of prose, do not make in any sense a connected story. Their
unknown collector arranged them as well as might be in connected
sequence, but even then their action is not consecutive; they overlap
each other, parts of the story are told and retold and not seldom with
an inconsistency of detail. There is, accordingly, in the "Elder Edda"
no thought of an epic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span> either in matter or manner. There is the material
for an epic in the rough, but without an idea in the mind of any poet of
the time of actual epical treatment.</p>

<p>The story as contained in the Old Norse poems is by no means identical
with the "Nibelungenlied." First and foremost, it is infinitely older in
its whole conception, and much more nearly approaches original
conditions as they existed in the mode of thought and in the manner of
living of the early Germanic people. It is a story, here, of the days
when the world was young; when the gods still walked the earth and mixed
themselves in with human affairs in which they had an active interest;
when motives were clearer and action was more direct; when human
passions burned even fiercer than in the "Nibelungenlied," and love and
hate together knew no boundaries until they had worked themselves out in
the utter destruction of their object. Of the first of these conditions,
the "Nibelungenlied" in its character of an epic of the Middle Ages has
not kept a trace. In the Eddic poems it is the ring cursed by the gods
to all its possessors that motives the entire action; that leads with
the certainty of fate to the death of Sigurd, the Siegfried of the
"Edda," to all the woes that follow, and to the ultimate utter
destruction of the entire race of the Nibelungs.</p>

<p>As most critics have pointed out, the fundamental difference in the
treatment of the story consists in the fact that the principal epic
interest in the Eddic poems is the relation of Sigurd to Brynhild, the
Valkyrie, who is here a heroic figure, who rises immeasurably not only
above the other women of the tale, but above most of the other
characters in importance of personality. In the "Nibelungenlied" it is
Kriemhild, Gudrun in the "Edda," and Hagen who are the principal figures
in the action. In the Northern version, Gudrun does not avenge herself
upon her brothers as does Kriemhild in the "Nibelungenlied," but Atli,
her husband after Sigurd, slays them, and Gudrun then takes vengeance
upon him. In the "Edda," too, other saga cycles are brought into
connection with this, viz., the Northern legend of Helgi, at the
beginning, and the Gothic legend of Ermanrich, at the end.</p>

<p>The Eddic poems are not the only versions in Old Norse literature. An
epitome of the story based upon the poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">vii</a></span> is contained in the "Snorra
Edda," a work written by the Icelander Snorri Sturluson, who lived from
1178 to 1241, to serve as a handbook for poets and which contains in
this way the myths and legends of the North.</p>

<p>Next to the Eddic songs the most important of the Northern versions,
however, is the long "Völsunga Saga" from the second half of the
thirteenth century, which, again, is based upon the Eddic poems and upon
others in addition that have now been lost. Like most of the Old Norse
sagas, it is prose with the occasional inclusion of verse cited to
justify or to embellish its statements. It gives with extraordinary
wealth of detail the whole old story in connected form and desires to be
called, as it has been called, a prose epic. William Morris, in his
superb translation, has deservedly characterized it as "the most
complete and dramatic form of the Great Epic of the North." The story is
further contained, in some of its details only, in the strange tale of
"Nornagest," which has again made use of the Eddic songs and quotes one
of them entire.</p>

<p>The Old Norse story is so important for its bearing on the
intelligibility of the "Nibelungenlied" that it is absolutely necessary
to take it actively into consideration in any discussion of the German
poem. The epitome contained in the "Snorra Edda," since it gives the
whole story from beginning to end in a form as short as may be, is here
given in its entirety:</p>

<p>"Three gods, Odin, H&#339;nir, and Loki, once went out to explore the
whole world. They came to a certain river, and went along the river to a
waterfall, and at the waterfall there was an otter that had taken a
salmon out of the fall and ate it, half asleep. Then Loki took up a
stone and cast it at the otter and struck him in the head. Loki
thereupon boasted of his catch that he had got at a blow both the otter
and the salmon. They took the salmon and the otter and carried them
along with them until they came to a farmstead, where they went in. The
head of the household that dwelt there was named Hreidmar; he was a
mighty man and much skilled in magic. He invited the gods to lodge there
for the night, and they told him that they had with them provisions in
plenty and showed him their booty. But when Hreidmar saw the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">viii</a></span> otter he
called his sons Fafnir and Regin and said that Otter, their brother, had
been killed, and told them who had done it. Thereupon, the father and
his sons fell upon the gods and took them and bound them, saying that
the otter was the son of Hreidmar. The gods offered as a ransom as much
money as Hreidmar himself should determine, and that was agreed upon as
a reconciliation and was bound with oaths.</p>

<p>"Then the otter was flayed, and Hreidmar took the otter's skin and said
that they should fill it with red gold and should then cover it wholly
up with gold, and that should be their atonement. Odin then sent Loki
into the land of the black elves and he came to the dwarf who is called
Andvari; he was a fish in the water, and Loki took him and laid upon him
as a ransom all the gold that he had in his stone. And when they came
into the stone where he dwelt, the dwarf brought out all the gold that
he owned and that was a very great treasure. Then the dwarf slipped
under his hand a little gold ring. That Loki, however, saw and bade him
produce the ring. The dwarf begged him not to take the ring from him,
and said that he could breed treasure out of it if he kept it. Loki told
him that he should not keep back a penny, and took the ring from him and
went out. The dwarf said that the ring should be the death of everyone
who owned it. Loki replied that that suited him well, and that the
condition should be held good, since he would bring it to the ears of
them who might get possession of it. He then went away to Hreidmar's and
showed Odin the gold; but when he saw the ring, it seemed to him very
beautiful and he took it out of the treasure, but paid over to Hreidmar
the gold.</p>

<p>"Then Hreidmar filled the otter's skin as full as he could and set it up
on its feet when it was full; Odin then went up to cover the skin with
gold and said to Hreidmar that he should see whether the skin were
wholly covered. Hreidmar looked at it and considered it carefully and
saw a whisker, and bade him cover that, also, or else their atonement
were at an end. Then Odin brought out the ring and covered the whisker
and said that they now were freed from the otter ransom. When, however,
Odin had taken his spear and Loki his shoes, and they needed no longer
to fear, then said Loki that what Andvari had spoken, that the ring
should be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span> death of him who owned it, should hold good, and it did
hold good thereafter.</p>

<p>"Hreidmar took the gold as ransom for his son, but Fafnir and Regin
demanded some of it as a ransom for their brother. Hreidmar, however,
would not grant them a single penny of the gold. That was the
ill-advised deed of the brothers that they killed their father for the
gold. Then Regin demanded that Fafnir divide the gold in halves between
them. Fafnir replied that there was little chance that he would share
the gold with his brother when he had killed his father for the sake of
it, and bade Regin to begone or he would fare as had Hreidmar. Fafnir
had then taken the helmet which Hreidmar had owned, which was called the
Helmet of Awe and which all living things feared that saw it, and set it
upon his head, and he took the sword which is called Hrotti. Regin had
the sword that is called Refil and he fled away; but Fafnir went up upon
the Glittering Heath and made him there a lair, and he took upon himself
the shape of a serpent and lay upon the gold.</p>

<p>"Regin then went to King Hjalprek, at Thy, in Denmark, and there set up
a smithy, and he took to foster Sigurd, the son of Sigmund (the son of
Volsung) and of Hjordis, the daughter of Eylimi. Sigurd was the most
glorious of all war kings in lineage and strength. Regin told him where
Fafnir lay upon the gold, and egged him on to seek it. Then Regin made
the sword that is called Gram, which was so sharp that Sigurd thrust it
in the water and it cut asunder a lock of wool that drove before the
current against the edge of the sword. Afterward, Sigurd clove in two
Regin's anvil down to the stock with the sword. After that, Sigurd and
Regin went out upon the Glittering Heath. Then Sigurd dug a pit in
Fafnir's path and got into it; and when Fafnir crept to the water and
came over the pit, then Sigurd thrust the sword up against him and that
was his death. Regin then came up and said that Sigurd had killed his
brother and offered him as a reconciliation that he should take the
heart of Fafnir and roast it at the fire; but Regin himself got down and
drank the blood of Fafnir and then lay down to sleep. And when Sigurd
had roasted the heart and thought that it must be done, he touched it
with his finger to see how hard it was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">x</a></span> And when the juice ran out of
the heart upon his finger, he burnt himself and thrust his finger into
his mouth. And when the heart's blood came upon his tongue, then he knew
the speech of birds and understood what the nuthatches said that sat in
the tree above him.</p>

<p>"Then said one:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There sits Sigurd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">blood besprinkled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">the heart of Fafnir<br /></span>
<span class="i0">at the fire roasting;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">wise methinks were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">the ring despoiler,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">if he the gleaming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">heart were eating.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Then said the other:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'There lies Regin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">with himself communing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">he will beguile the youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">who is trusting in him;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">in rage he brings now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">ill words together;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">the evil-worker will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">avenge his brother.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Then Sigurd went up to Regin and killed him, and took his horse, which
was named Grani, and rode until he came to the lair of Fafnir. There he
took the gold and bound it up in packs and laid it on the back of Grani,
and then mounted and rode on his way. Sigurd rode until he found a house
upon the fell. Within it slept a woman who had on a helmet and a coat of
mail. He drew his sword and cut her coat of mail off her. Then she awoke
and named herself Hild. She is called Brynhild and was a Valkyrie.
Sigurd rode thence and came to the King who is named Gjuki; his wife is
named Grimhild; their children were Gunnar, Högni, Gudrun, Gudny;
Gotthorm was a step-son of Gjuki. There Sigurd dwelt for a long time;
and he took to wife Gudrun, the daughter of Gjuki, and Gunnar and Högni
swore with him oaths of brotherhood. Afterward, Sigurd and the sons of
Gjuki went to Atli, the son of Budli, to ask as a wife for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">xi</a></span> Gunnar
Brynhild, his sister. She dwelt upon Hind Fell, and about her hall was a
flaming fire, and she had made a vow to have as a husband that man,
only, who dared to ride through the flame.</p>

<p>"Then Sigurd and the Gjukings (who are also called Niflungs) rode up
upon the fell, and Gunnar was minded to ride through the flame. He had
the horse that was named Goti, but the horse did not dare to leap into
the fire. Then Sigurd and Gunnar changed their shapes and also their
names, since Grani would not go under any man except Sigurd. Then Sigurd
leaped upon Grani and rode through the flaming fire. That night he held
a wedding with Brynhild, and when they came to bed he drew the sword
Gram out of its scabbard and laid it between them. And in the morning,
when he awoke and dressed himself, then he gave Brynhild as a bridal
gift the gold ring which he had taken on the Glittering Heath, and Loki
had taken from Andvari, and he took from her another ring as a
remembrance. Sigurd then leaped upon his horse and rode to his
companions; Gunnar and he again changed their shapes and they went back
to Gjuki with Brynhild. Sigurd had two children with Gudrun: Sigmund and
Swanhild.</p>

<p>"It was once upon a time that Brynhild and Gudrun went to the water to
bleach their hair. When they came to the river, Brynhild waded out into
the water away from the land and said that she would not have on her
head the water that ran out of Gudrun's hair, since she had the more
noble husband. Then Gudrun went out into the river after Brynhild and
said that she should wash her hair in the river above, because she had
the husband who was braver than anyone else in the world, since he slew
Fafnir and Regin and gained the inheritance of them both. Then Brynhild
replied: 'It was of still greater renown that Gunnar rode the flaming
fire and Sigurd dared not.' Then Gudrun laughed and said: 'Do you think
that Gunnar rode through the flaming fire? Him I deem to have gone to
bed with you, who gave me this gold ring. But the ring that you have on
your hand, and that you received as a bridal gift, that is called the
Ring of Andvari, and I deem that it was not Gunnar who sought it on the
Glittering Heath.' Then Brynhild was silent and went home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">xii</a></span> After that
she egged on Gunnar and Högni to kill Sigurd, but because they had sworn
oaths with him they egged on Gotthorm, their brother, to kill him.
Gotthorm laid sword on him while he slept, and when he felt the wound he
hurled the sword Gram after his slayer so that it cut the man asunder.
Then Sigurd fell and his three-year old son, who was named Sigmund, whom
they killed. After that, Brynhild turned sword upon herself and she was
burned with Sigurd. And Gunnar and Högni took the treasure of Fafnir and
the Ring of Andvari and ruled all the land.</p>

<p>"King Atli, the son of Budli, the brother of Brynhild, then took to wife
Gudrun, whom Sigurd had had, and they had children together. King Atli
bade Gunnar and Högni to visit him, and they went at his invitation, but
before they went away from home they hid the gold, the Treasure of
Andvari, in the river Rhine, and it has never since been found. And King
Atli had assembled a great force and fought with Gunnar and Högni and
they were taken prisoners. And Atli had the heart cut out of Högni while
he lived, and that was his death. Gunnar he caused to be cast into a
serpent pit, and a harp was brought to him secretly and he struck it
with his toes, since his hands were bound, so that all the serpents
slept except one adder, which sprang at him, and struck in through his
breast so that she thrust in her head and hung upon his liver until he
died. Gunnar and Högni are called Niflungs and Gjukungs, and for this
reason the gold is called the Treasure of the Niflungs, or their
inheritance. A little while after, Gudrun killed her two sons, and with
gold and silver had beakers made out of their skulls and then was
celebrated the funeral feast of the Niflungs.</p>

<p>"At this banquet Gudrun had King Atli served with mead from the beakers,
and there was mixed with it the blood of the boys, and their hearts she
caused to be roasted and brought to the King to eat. And when that was
done she told him these things herself with many ugly words. There was
no lack there of intoxicating mead, so that most people slept where they
sat. And in the night she went to the King where he was sleeping, and
with her the son of Högni, and they fell upon him, and that was his
death. Then they hurled fire into the hall and the people were burned
that were within. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">xiii</a></span> that she went to the sea and leaped in and
wished to destroy herself, but she drifted over the fjord and came to
the land of King Jonakr. And when he saw her, he took her to him and
wedded her. They had three sons, who were called Sörli, Hamdir, and Erp;
they were all as black as ravens in the color of their hair, like Gunnar
and Högni and the other Niflungs.</p>

<p>"There grew up Swanhild, the daughter of Sigurd; she was the most
beautiful of all women. That Jörmunrek the Mighty learned and sent his
son Randver to ask her hand. And when he came to Jonakr, Swanhild was
given over to him that he might bring her to Jörmunrek. Then said Bikki
that it had fallen out better if Randver had Swanhild, since he was
young, as were they both, and Jörmunrek was old. This counsel pleased
the young people well; and thereupon Bikki told it to the King. Then
Jörmunrek had his son taken and brought to the gallows, but Randver took
his falcon and plucked off the feathers and bade that it be sent to his
father; then he was hanged. But when King Jörmunrek saw the falcon, it
came into his mind that just as the falcon was incapable of flight and
featherless, so was also his kingdom disabled, since he was old and
without a son.</p>

<p>"It was once upon a time when King Jörmunrek rode out of the forest from
hunting with his men that Swanhild the Queen sat bleaching her hair.
Then they rode upon her and trod her to death under the horses' hoofs.
And when Gudrun learned this, she egged on her sons to avenge Swanhild.
And when they made ready for the journey, she got them mail, and helmets
so strong that iron would not take hold upon it. She said the plan for
them to follow was that when they came to King Jörmunrek they should
fall upon him at night while he slept; Sörli and Hamdir should then hew
off his hands and feet, and Erp his head. When, however, they came on
the way, they asked Erp what assistance they might have of him if they
met King Jörmunrek. He replied that he would give them such aid as the
hand gave the foot. They replied that naught at all did the foot depend
upon the hand. They were so angry at their mother that she had led them
out with words of hatred, that they desired to do that which should be
the worst thing of all to her and they killed Erp, since she loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">xiv</a></span> him
most. A little while after, as Sörli walked along he slipped with both
feet, but held himself up with his hand. Then he said: 'The hand does
now help the foot; better it were that Erp were alive!' And when they
came to King Jörmunrek's at night, and went in where he slept and hewed
off his hands and feet, he awoke and called upon his men and bade them
awaken. Then said Hamdir: 'Off were now his head, if Erp were alive!'
Then the men-at-arms arose and attacked them, but could not overcome
them with weapons. Jörmunrek then called out that stones should be
hurled at them, and this was done. Then Sörli and Hamdir fell, and then
were dead all the race and descendants of the Gjukings."</p>

<p>The Eddic poems and the "Völsunga Saga" give us even much more fully in
detail than does this epitome the deeds of Sigurd's youth of which the
"Nibelungenlied" knows so little. The latter, too, has forgotten the
early relationship of Sigurd to Brynhild and her whole early history,
although her superhuman character is still remembered and obscure
reference is made to their previous acquaintance. There is no longer a
reason why Siegfried and Brunhild should die together, as in the "Edda."
That the ultimate catastrophe falls out differently in the two versions
of the story is due to this very fact of the loss of original detail. In
that her brothers who had murdered Sigurd live in triumph afterward and
no true reconciliation can be possible between them, Kriemhild must of
necessity avenge herself upon them, instead of upon Atli, as in the
earlier form of the story. And, as has already been remarked, the real
significance to the action of the fateful "Ring of the Nibelungs" and
the accursed hoard has wholly vanished to give place to reasons that
have much more affinity with human motives of conduct.</p>

<p>The "Nibelungenlied," like the Northern poems before it, is legendary,
with only here and there a historical fact as a nucleus about which has
gathered in the course of the centuries material for many times and
places. The destruction of the Burgundians, under their King Gunther, by
the Huns, which occurred in the year 437, has undoubtedly furnished the
ultimate catastrophe. It is not known, however, that Attila, the Atli of
the "Edda" and the Etzel of the "Nibelungenlied," was the leader of the
Huns on this occasion, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> the event did take place during his
lifetime. Attila's brother Bleda appears in the poem as Bl&#339;delin.
Giselher, the brother of Gunther, is also mentioned in the old
Burgundian law-code, the <i>Lex Burgundionum</i>. Of Siegfried and Brunhild
history knows no trace, although an attempt has been made to connect the
one with Arminius and the other with Brünehild of Austrasia. The
appearance in the poem of Dietrich of Bern, Theodoric the Great, the
Ostrogothic conqueror of Italy, who lived from 475 to 526, is an example
of the absorption of material from another cycle into the original
legend, material which, in its turn, clusters about a historical
character. The Bishop Pilgrin, of Passau, represented in the poem as the
uncle of the Burgundian kings and of Kriemhild, has a historical
prototype in an actual Pilgrin who held the see of Passau from 971 to
991 and has, it may be, been here introduced by the poet to honor him.
As for the rest, facts that may have been ultimately historical have
been freely used by the poet of the "Nibelungenlied" and his
predecessors until it is no longer possible to tell where legend begins
and history ends.</p>

<p>That Siegfried and Brunhild are at the end mythical, rather than at all
historical, has been surmised, rather than proved. It has been
attempted, in point of fact, to show that the whole story has arisen in
its earliest form through a union of an old myth of Siegfried with the
historical materials that have been indicated and others whose real
significance has subsequently been obliterated and lost. The believers
of this theory have pointed to the thoroughly mythical character of the
version of the story in the "Edda" and particularly of its earliest part
as plausible evidence, and they would see in the whole the union of a
Frankish myth of Siegfried, originally independent, with a Burgundian
historical narrative. Siegfried and Brunhild, in this way, have been
thought to embody, at the beginning, the nature-myth of the awakening
earth-goddess from the sleep of winter at the reanimating touch of
summer. Lachmann makes the fundamental fact at the outset a myth of the
death of Balder, and Wilhelm Müller a myth of Freyr, both light-gods of
the old mythology. It is, nevertheless, impossible to follow the
upholders of these theories into the details of their interpretation,
and the whole main assumption<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">xvi</a></span> of a mythical origin is a matter of
doubt. That Siegfried and Brunhild, however, have mythical
characteristics that they have retained after all memory of the ancient
mythology as such has been absolutely forgotten, no reader of the story
can deny, and in this respect the "Nibelungenlied" is no different from
the legendary literature of all the nations of the world.</p>

<p>Early German poems on the story of the Nibelungs, although it is
altogether likely that they once existed, have not been preserved. The
"Nibelungenlied" itself it is not possible to follow back of the twelfth
century, by the middle of which it seems to have already had the form in
which it has come down to us. The internal evidence of metre, rhyme, and
language shows, too, beyond a doubt, that it could not have arisen at a
much earlier time.</p>

<p>The author of the poem is unknown. The most plausible hypothesis as to
his actual personality makes him an Austrian knight of about 1140,
possibly a member of the Kürenberg family, who lived in the neighborhood
of Linz, on the Danube. A Kürenberg of the twelfth century is the oldest
court poet who used in his lyrics the same strophic form that is
characteristic of the "Nibelungenlied," but that the two poets are
identical is by no manner of means a certainty. In the same way, the
place of origin of the poem is a matter of supposition. In all
probability, however, it arose in southeastern German territory in
Austria. Although the poet knows the region on the Rhine about Worms, he
has an infinitely wider acquaintance with Austrian localities of which
he makes specific mention. It was in Austria, too, at this time that the
beginnings arose of the court lyric poetry, that Minnesangs Frühling, as
the Germans strikingly characterize the period, that presently blossomed
out into one of the fullest expressions in all its history of German
life and thought.</p>

<p>Bartsch, in the introduction to his edition of the "Nibelungenlied," has
most admirably summarized this whole matter. According to him, it was an
Austrian poet who, before the middle of the twelfth century, united
songs sung at his time and oral tradition, known to him as well as to
everybody else, into a single whole. How far folk-song and tradition had
anticipated him in this is no longer to be ascertained, but it may be
inferred from the Northern form of the legend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">xvii</a></span> that it had long since
taken place. It remained to him, however, to arrange the whole in its
details of sequence of action, to fill out the gaps left by popular song
and story, and to give it the impress of his own day, which it so
unmistakably bears. That this is not in accord with other ideas of
authorship and origin must nevertheless be stated. Karl Lachmann, one of
the most astute, if not one of the most mistaken, critics of the poem,
taking Wolf's Prolegomena to Homer for his model, set up the theory that
has since played an important part in the discussion of the genesis of
the "Nibelungenlied."</p>

<p>According to the Lachmann theory, the poem consists of no less than
twenty distinct lays, each differing inherently from the rest, and each,
with the exception of the Eighth and Ninth, by different authors. To
arrive at this result, more than a third of the entire number of stanzas
has, for one reason or another, been rejected as not genuine. As Lettsom
has cleverly put it in the original preface to his translation, where
this whole matter is presented with some detail: "He [Lachmann] has in
fact put every stanza and every verse on its trial. Some have been
condemned by him to italics, as interpolations; others to brackets, as
continuations by different hands; others again, which he supposes to be
the latest additions, so far from being pitied for their youth, have
been visited with both kinds of punishment. He has not, however,
sentenced any of the delinquents to transportation from the text; or,
perhaps it would be more correct to say that he has sentenced them, but
has not carried the sentence into execution. The result of the whole
assize has been that out of the 2,316 stanzas 1,437 have been honorably
acquitted; the rest have been italicised, bracketed, or both.... The
twenty lays," he continues, "which had already suffered from the
interpolations and corruptions incident to oral tradition, were first
collected, committed to writing, and patched together into one poem
about the year 1210 by some unknown compiler, whose handiwork was
afterward corrected or depraved by two separate but equally unknown
revisers. It is his opinion that scarcely a stanza of what we possess is
older than 1190, while even the latest additions are not more recent
than 1225. The whole poem, therefore, is, according to Professor
Lachmann, the work of contemporary authors, whether we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">xviii</a></span> call their
compositions spurious or genuine; and the task undertaken is neither
more nor less than to distribute a mass of unowned literary property
among nineteen or twenty poets and an indefinite number of poetasters,
of whom nothing, not even their existence, is known except by
conjecture, and of whose distinguishing characteristics we are of course
completely ignorant, except as far as we may guess at them from the
internal evidence, real or imagined, of the poem itself."</p>

<p>Lachmann's theory of separate authorship of portions of the poem has not
maintained itself against the critics. That there are contradictions in
its statements and different values in its parts cannot be denied, but
they are not explained on the grounds here set forth. The attempted
restoration of the poem by elimination and rearrangement has not left
twenty or any number of lays that have actually the air of being
separate poems. "It is just here," continues Lettsom, "that the failure
of the hypothesis is most conspicuous.... Some of the lays are not
ill-adapted, from the nature of their contents, to form separate poems,
but they are by no means out of place as episodes in a long work, and
are, besides, connected with the rest, while the latter, from the
insignificance of their contents alone, from their reference to one
another, from their allusions to the past and anticipations of the
future, from their abrupt commencements and still more abrupt
conclusions, and from their general fragmentary nature, could never have
been independent lays.... The dream of Kriemhild forms a strange opening
for a lay that just brings Siegfried to Worms, and there leaves him.
Nobody, in fact, would have composed a separate poem on so insignificant
a matter. The dream, however, is beyond all doubt the introduction, the
fit and appropriate introduction, to a poem that must go on at least to
the marriage of Kriemhild and the death of her husband.</p>

<p>"Professor Lachmann himself seems to be in doubt whether this First Lay
be complete; he talks of 'this lay, or what has been preserved of it;'
he tells us that 'it several times indicates a continuation, and might
have deserved a better than that which follows;' but though he expresses
a doubt, he gives no reasons for entertaining one. It certainly would
require far less ingenuity to assign cogent reasons for a doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">xix</a></span> and
indeed for much more than a doubt, on this point; the lay, as it stands,
is a 'passage that leads to nothing,' a mountain in labor that does not
produce even so much as a mouse; but it is not singular in this respect;
its brethren for the most part keep it in countenance; or, if they
contain matter of interest, they too often try the temper of the reader
by disappointing his expectations at the most critical moment, and
coming to an abrupt conclusion in the midst of an action. Thus the
Eighteenth Lay ends just after the battle between Huns and Burgundians
has begun; the Nineteenth stops short just at the moment when Etzel has
brought up 20,000 fresh men and commenced another attack on Gunther and
his followers.</p>

<p>"It really is a waste of words to dwell on the peculiarities of such
whimsical arrangements as these. I will merely add a word or two on the
Fourteenth Lay, which, inasmuch as it is an introduction to what
follows, bears some resemblance to the First. The dream of Uta, the
prophecy of the mermaids, and all the gloomy forebodings which give a
peculiar character to this lay, are ludicrously out of place as
component parts of a short poem, which merely conducts the Burgundians
to Rudeger's castle, where, so far from being destroyed, they do not
even run any risk whatever, except that of being killed with kindness;
but in fact the whole tenor of the lay (one might almost say, every
line, every word of it) proves beyond dispute that we are there in the
midst of an extensive poem, which can end only with the destruction of
the last Burgundian. An attentive examination of the three or four lays
just noticed, would, I think, convince every unprejudiced reader that
the hypothesis of twenty separate lays by different authors is utterly
untenable.... The wisest course," he concludes, and it is easy to concur
with him, "is, in such uncertainty, to take the poem as we find it, and
to prefer the authority, however occasionally unsatisfactory, of
manuscripts to the speculations of the most ingenious critics."</p>

<p>The metre of the "Nibelungenlied" needs a word of explanation. The
characteristic strophe in which it is written consists of four verses,
the first three of equal length, the fourth somewhat longer, rhymed in
couplets on the final syllable. The rhythmical system is dependent, not
upon measure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">xx</a></span> but upon accent, with considerable freedom in the
addition or suppression of unaccented syllables. Every verse, with the
exception of the last, is made up of two half-verses each containing
three accented syllables and separated by a ringing cæsura, that is, a
cæsura on an unaccented syllable. The last half-verse contains an
additional accent, or four, instead of three, as in the others. A
strophe in the original Middle High German, the second of the poem, will
make this analysis clear:</p>

<div class="poem" lang="de" xml:lang="de"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ez wúohs in Búregónden      ein vil édel magedî&#769;n,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">dáz in állen lánden &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; niht sch&#339;&#769;ners móhte sî&#769;n,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">dar úmbe múosen dégene &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; víl verlíesen den lî&#769;p.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The metre of the present translation follows the original, except for
the lengthening of the fourth line of the stanza which the author only
occasionally differentiates in this respect from the rest.</p>

<p>The "Nibelungenlied," like other poems of the Middle Ages that were
widely read and widely copied, was subjected all along its career of
transmission to additions and alterations, and has consequently come
down to us not in a single form, but in a number of different versions
that deviate to a greater or less extent from the original poem and from
each other. Whole or in part there are no less than twenty-eight MSS.
Ten of these are complete: three of them, usually cited A, B, C, are
parchment MSS. of the thirteenth century, two are parchments of the
fourteenth century, four are paper MSS. of the fifteenth century, and
one is a parchment of the sixteenth century. Of all these manuscripts it
is commonly conceded that only A, B, C have independent authenticity. It
is not necessary here to go into the details of the long discussion as
to the relative value of the MSS. with regard to the age and original
condition of the particular text which each contains. Each one has by
different critics been given the preference over the others.</p>

<p>Zarncke, who is one of the most rational and impartial of the critics of
the poem in all its bearings, makes C, a beautifully written MS. from
the dividing line between the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
preserved in the court library of Donaueschingen, the nearest in every
essential way to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">xxi</a></span> original form of the poem. Subsequently, the
whole, according to him, was subjected to a revision which brought it
more into accord with contemporary taste. The text is amplified by the
introduction of new episodes into the narrative, although some of the
older strophes are omitted, and, unfortunately, the old dignity and
simplicity of the diction is frequently sacrificed in favor of a more
pronounced effect. This stage of the poem in its full form is not
represented in either of the oldest MSS. B, a manuscript from the middle
of the thirteenth century, in the monastery of St. Gallen, occupied an
intermediate position in length. It is made by Bartsch, who regards it
"as relatively the most faithful picture of the original form of the
lost poem," the basis of his edition of the "Nibelungenlied." A, a
carelessly written MS. in the Munich Library, is the shortest form of
the poem, but is, nevertheless, in its turn regarded by Lachmann as
inherently the oldest and best version that we possess. Lettsom's
translation, in that it follows the text and modern German version of
Braunfels, published in 1846, is based upon A, but with the inclusion of
other strophes, particularly from C.</p>

<p>The "Nibelungenlied" was first published at Zurich, by Bodmer, in 1757,
and since then has appeared in many editions and modernized versions at
home, and in numerous translations abroad, among them Low German,
French, Italian, Dutch, and Hungarian.</p>

<p>In English, the first translations of parts of the "Nibelungenlied" are
contained in the "Illustrations of Northern Antiquities," by Weber,
published in 1814, in Edinburgh. The version here given consists in part
only of a metrical translation, in part of prose. Lockhart, in his
biography of Sir Walter Scott, states that he has no doubt but that the
rhymed versions came from that poet's pen, although of this there is no
more direct proof. The second attempt in this direction is not less
notable. This is from 1831, when Thomas Carlyle wrote in the
"Westminster Review" an essay on the "Nibelungenlied" as a review of
Karl Simrock's German translation of the poem, in which are contained a
number of strophes given with characteristic vigor and a genuine
appreciation of the real spirit of the original. The next translation,
that of Gostik, in his "Spirit of German Poetry," 1846, is metrical,
but, like its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">xxii</a></span> predecessors, consists only of parts of the poem. The
first translation to lay claim to any degree of completeness was that of
Jonathan Birch, published in 1848. It is a metrical version, as its
title states, of Lachmann's text, and, like it, divides the poem into
twenty lays. The first complete edition of the poem in English does not,
however, appear until this of Lettsom's, which has admirably retained
the form of the original and much of its spirit, and which for the first
time gave to English readers an adequate idea of the real work as it is.</p>

<p>For those who care to pursue the subject further than these pages it may
be stated that the best editions of the "Nibelungenlied" in the original
are those of Friedrich Zarncke, "<i>Das Nibelungenlied</i>," originally
published in 1856 and since then in several editions, and of Karl
Bartsch, "<i>Das Nibelungenlied</i>," originally published in 1866, both of
which have abundant critical apparatus. The "Nibelungenlied" is not yet
sufficiently well known among us, for it is, in the way that has been
indicated, not alone the great epic of Germany, but in its widest sense
an epic of the Germanic race.</p>

<p class="verse">
In Burgundy there flourish'd a maid so fair to see,<br />
That in all the world together a fairer could not be.<br />
This maiden's name was Kriemhild; through her in dismal strife<br />
Full many a prowest warrior thereafter lost his life.<br />

Many a fearless champion, as such well became,<br />

<p class="center">V</p>

<p class="verse">
They were high of lineage, thereto mild of mood,<br />

Dame Uta was their mother, a queen both rich and sage;<br />

Each of these three princes, as you have heard me say,<br />

Dankwart was marshal to the king his lord,<br />

To her mother Uta at once the dream she told,<br />

In Netherland then flourished a prince of lofty kind,<br />

In a sumptuous castle down by the Rhine's fair side;<br />

Siegfried men did call him, that same champion good;<br />

<p class="center">IV</p>

<p class="verse">
Before this noble champion grew up to man's estate,<br />

<p class="center">VI</p>

As did well befit him, he was bred with care,<br />

<p class="center">VIII</p>

The child by his fond parents was deck'd with weeds of pride,<br />

Now had he strength and stature that weapons well he bore;<br />

Then bade his father Siegmund all his liegemen tell,<br />

Forthwith to the high minster flock'd many a squire along,<br />

But first to God's due honor a holy mass they sung,<br />

All ran at once, where saddled many a war-horse stood.<br />

<p class="center">XVIII</p>

Old and young together fiercely hurtling flew,<br />

<p class="verse">
The king, too, as his father to him before had done,<br />

The gorgeous feast it lasted till the seventh day was o'er;<br />

<p class="center">II</p>

By fame her peerless beauty was bruited far and wide,<br />

Then sought the son of Siegelind to gain the haughty fair;<br />

Now had the fearless giant all his weapons donn'd,<br />

"How could he dare to call up men of mettle so?"<br />

"I'm ready at his bidding," the lovely maid replied,<br />

<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="verse">
Beyond the Rhine King Gunther, with many a well-arm'd rank<br />
And all his guests about him, rode toward the river's bank;<br />
You might see by the bridle led forward many a maid.<br />
Those, who were to receive them, were ready all array'd.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="verse">
Soon as the men of Issland came to the shallops down,<br />
And eke the Nibelungers, lieges of Siegfried's crown,<br />
To th' other shore they hasten'd (busy was ever hand)<br />
Where them the friends of Gunther awaited on the strand.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="verse">
Now hear, by wealthy Uta what a device was wrought.<br />
Down with her from the castle a virgin train she brought,<br />
That rode where she was riding in that procession bright;<br />
So many a maid acquainted became with many a knight.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">IV</p>

<p class="verse">
Kriemhild by the bridle the Margrave Gary led.<br />
But only from the castle; then forward Siegfried sped,<br />
And did that gentle service; fair was the blushing maid;<br />
Full well for that thereafter the warrior she repaid.<br />

<p class="center">V</p>

<p class="verse">
Ortwine, the fearless champion, rode by Dame Uta's rein;<br />
Knights and maids together followed, a social train.<br />
At such a stately meeting, all must confess, I ween,<br />
So many lovely ladies were ne'er together seen.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">VI</p>

<p class="verse">
Full many a famous champion careering you might spy<br />
(Ill there were sloth and idless) beneath fair Kriemhild's eye<br />
E'en to the place of landing; by knights of fair renown<br />
There many a high-born lady from steed was lifted down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span><br />
</p>


<p class="center">VII</p>

<p class="verse">
The king was now come over, and many a worthy guest.<br />
Ah! before the ladies what spears were laid in rest!<br />
How many went in shivers at every hurtling close!<br />
Buckler clashed with buckler; ah! what a din arose!<br />
</p>


<p class="center">VIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Now might you see the ladies fast by the haven stand.<br />
With his guests King Gunther debark'd upon the strand,<br />
In his hand soft leading the martial maiden fair.<br />
Then each on each flash'd radiance, rich robes and jewels rare.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">IX</p>

<p class="verse">
With that the smiling Kriemhild forth stepp'd a little space,<br />
And Brunhild and her meiny greeted with gentle grace.<br />
Each with snowy fingers back her headband drew,<br />
And either kiss'd the other lovingly and true.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">X</p>

<p class="verse">
Then spoke in courteous manner Kriemhild the fair and free,<br />
"In this our land, dear Brunhild, ever welcome be<br />
To me and to my mother and all by us allow'd<br />
For faithful friends and liegemen," Then each to th' other bow'd.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XI</p>

<p class="verse">
Next to greet Dame Brunhild approach'd Dame Uta too;<br />

Never was known a welcome so kind and frank as this.<br />

<p class="center">XII</p>

<p class="verse">
Soon as Brunhild's women were all come to the strand,<br />
Many a courtly warrior took by her lily hand<br />
A lady fair, and gently her mincing steps upstay'd.<br />
Now before Dame Brunhild stood many a noble maid.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XIII</p>

<p class="verse">
'Twas long before the greeting had gone through all the list.<br />
On either part in plenty rosy mouths were kiss'd.<br />
Still the two fair princesses were standing side by side,<br />
A pair with love and rapture by longing warriors ey'd.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span><br />
</p>


<p class="center">XIV</p>

<p class="verse">
What erst had been but rumor, was now made clear to sight,<br />
That naught had yet been witness'd so beautiful and bright<br />
As those two lovely damsels; 'twas plain to every eye;<br />
None the slightest blemish in either form could spy.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XV</p>

<p class="verse">
Whoever look'd on women with but the sight for guide,<br />
Such for her faultless beauty prais'd Gunther's stately bride;<br />
But those, whose thoughts went deeper, and div'd into the mind,<br />
Maintained that gentle Kriemhild left Brunhild far behind.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XVI</p>

<p class="verse">
Now met the dames and damsels in friendly converse free;<br />
Fair robes and fairer beauties were there in store to see;<br />
Many a silk pavilion and many a gorgous tent<br />
The plain before the city fill'd in its whole extent.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XVII</p>

<p class="verse">
King Gunther's kinsmen ceas'd not to press to that fair show.<br />
And now was begg'd each princess from the sun to go<br />
Close by, with their attendants, where shade was overhead.<br />
By bold Burgundian warriors thither were they led.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XVIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Then clomb to horse the heroes, and scour'd the sounding field;<br />
Many a joust was practised with order'd spear and shield;<br />
Right well were prov'd the champions, and o'er the trampled plain,<br />
As though the land were burning, the dust curl'd up amain.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XIX</p>

<p class="verse">
So all before the ladies display'd their skill and force.<br />
Nor doubt I that Sir Siegfried rode many a knightly course<br />
Before the rich pavilions, and, ever as he sped,<br />
His thousand Nibelungers, a stately squadron, led.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XX</p>

<p class="verse">
Then came the knight of Trony by the good king's command;<br />
In friendly wise he parted the jousters on the strand,<br />
For fear the dust, now thick'ning, the ladies might molest.<br />
Him with ready reverence obey'd each gentle guest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span><br />

<p class="center">XXI</p>

Then spake the noble Gernot, "Let each now rest his steed<br />

These lovely ladies homeward e'en to the palace wide.<br />
So keep yourselves all ready till it please the king to ride."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXII</p>

<p class="verse">
Thus ended was the tourney, and now the warriors went<br />
To join the dames and damsels beneath each lofty tent,<br />
And there in gentle converse their grace and favor sought;<br />
So flew the hours in pastime till of riding home they thought.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Now as drew on the twilight, when cooler grew the air<br />
And the sun was setting, they would not linger there,<br />
But up rose lords and ladies to seek the castle high;<br />
Many a fair dame was cherish'd by many a love-lit eye.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXIV</p>

<p class="verse">
So on the fair they waited as from good knights is due.<br />
Then hardy squires, hot-spurring before the nobles' view,<br />
After the country's custom rode for the prize of weed<br />
As far as to the palace, where sprung the king from steed.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXV</p>

<p class="verse">
There too the proud queens parted, each taking thence her way.<br />
Dame Uta and her daughter with their handmaids gay<br />
Into a spacious chamber both together went.<br />
There might you hear on all sides the sound of merriment.<br />

<p class="center">XXVI</p>

<p class="verse">
In hall the seats were order'd; the king would instant hie<br />
With all his guests to table; beside him you might spy<br />
His lovely bride, Queen Brunhild; her royal crown she wore<br />
There in King Gunther's country; so rich was none before.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXVII</p>

<p class="verse">
Seats were there plac'd unnumber'd with tables broad and good,<br />
As is to us reported, full heap'd with costly food.<br />
How little there was wanted that passes for the best!<br />
There with the king was seated full many a noble guest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span><br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXVIII</p>

<p class="verse">
The chamberlains of Gunther in ewers of ruddy gold<br />
Brought to the guests the water; should you be ever told<br />
That at a prince's table service was better done,<br />
'Twere labor lost to say so, 't would be believ'd by none.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXIX</p>

<p class="verse">
Then, ere the Lord of Rhineland touch'd the water bright,<br />
Up to him, as befitted, went Siegfried the good knight,<br />
And brought to him remembrance the promise made him there,<br />
Ere yet afar in Issland he look'd on Brunhild fair.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXX</p>

<p class="verse">
Said he, "You must remember what swore to me your hand,<br />
That, soon as Lady Brunhild were come into this land,<br />
To me you'd give your sister; your oaths now where are they?<br />
On me throughout your journey much toil and travail lay."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXI</p>

<p class="verse">
"Well did you to remind me," the noble king replied,<br />
"By what my hand has promis'd, I ever will abide,<br />
And in this thing to serve you will do my best, my all."<br />
Then sent he to beg Kriemhild to come into the hall.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXII</p>

<p class="verse">
Straight to the hall came Kriemhild begirt with many a maid,<br />
When from the lofty staircase young Giselher thus said,<br />
"Send back your maidens, Kriemhild, this business is your own;<br />
On this the king our brother would speak with you alone."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Then forward led was Kriemhild, as Gunther gave command,<br />
Where stood the king, and round him from many a prince's land<br />
Were noble knights unnumber'd; at once all silence kept;<br />
At that same instant Brunhild had just to table stepp'd.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXIV</p>

<p class="verse">
Thence came it, she knew nothing of what was to be done.<br />
Then to his gather'd kinsmen spoke Dankrat's royal son,<br />
"Help me to move my sister Siegfried for lord to take."<br />
"Such match," they all gave answer, "with honor she may make."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span><br />

<p class="center">XXXV</p>

Then spoke the king to Kriemhild, "Sister, I ask of thee<br />
From an oath to set me by thy kindness free.<br />
Thee to a knight I promised; if thou become his bride,<br />
Thou'lt do the will of Gunther, and show thy love beside."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXVI</p>

<p class="verse">
Then spake the noble maiden, "Dearest brother mine,<br />
It needed not to ask me; whate'er command be thine,<br />
I'll willingly perform it; so now, for thy sake,<br />
Whom thou for husband giv'st me, fain I, my lord, will take."<br />

<p class="center">XXXVII</p>

<p class="verse">
With love and eke with pleasure redden'd Siegfried's hue;<br />
At once to lady Kriemhild he pledg'd his service true.<br />
They bade them stand together in the courtly circle bright.<br />
And ask'd her if for husband she took that lofty knight.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXVIII</p>

<p class="verse">
In modest maiden fashion she blush'd a little space,<br />
But such was Siegfried's fortune and his earnest grace,<br />
That not altogether could she deny her hand.<br />
Then her for wife acknowledg'd the noble King of Netherland.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXIX</p>

<p class="verse">
He thus to her affianc'd, and to him the maid,<br />
Straight round the long-sought damsel in blushing grace array'd<br />
His arms with soft emotion th' enamour'd warrior threw,<br />

</p>


<p class="center">XL</p>

<p class="verse">
On this up broke the circle, and to the feast they came;<br />
There high-advanc'd Sir Siegfried sat with his spoused dame<br />
Right opposite to Gunther; him many a vassal true<br />

High at the feast sat Gunther and Brunhild by his side,<br />

Sitting by valiant Siegfried; she straight began to weep,<br />

"Good cause have I for weeping," return'd the angry fair;<br />

Then spake the noble Gunther, "No more of this, I pray;<br />

Thereto made answer Gunther, "That will I tell you straight.<br />

Whatever he could tell her, her gloomy mood she kept.<br />

<p class="center">XLVIII</p>

Thought he, 't were softer lying in a marriage bed.<br />

</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="verse">
In her heart his thought she foster'd deep in its inmost core;<br />

Said she, "Dear lord, for my sake thy efforts join with mine,<br />

They set in gold far-beaming, and glitter'd both so bright,<br />

Now we awhile must leave them on household toils intent,<br />

From the Nibelungers' country to the Rhine's fair shore.<br />
Such plenty of rich vesture never sumpters bore.<br />

<p class="verse">
Dispatch'd were travelling cases well fraught with precious load;<br />
Then with his queen and comrades Sir Siegfried forward rode.<br />
Her heart with pleasure's promise was ready to o'erflow;<br />
All was chang'd thereafter to wail and mortal woe.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="verse">
At home, since so it needed, they left their infant heir,<br />
The son that valiant Siegfried begot on Kriemhild fair.<br />
To the poor boy misfortune that fatal journey bore;<br />
His father and his mother saw he never more.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">IV</p>

<p class="verse">
And with them good Sir Siegmund prick'd forth in merry mood.<br />
Had he but once foreboded the woes that thence ensued,<br />

<p class="center">V</p>

Dispatch'd before were couriers to say they were at hand<br />
Straight rode out to meet them a royal vested band,<br />

<p class="center">VI</p>

<p class="verse">
Forthwith he sought out Brunhild, where sat the stately dame.<br />
"How did my sister greet you when first you hither came?<br />
So greet the wife of Siegfried, take care to fail in nought."<br />
"So will I," said she, "gladly; I love her as I ought."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span><br />

"To-morrow they'll be with us," said he, "by early day,<br />

She bade her dames and damsels look out their choicest vests,<br />

<p class="center">XVII</p>

Chieftain now to chieftain held out the cordial hand;<br />
Low bows were made in plenty by either courtly band.<br />

They linger'd there no longer, but toward the city rode.<br />

Then thought she on the secret (the truth she durst not tell)<br />

She thus bespake her husband, "Give up that chase of thine.<br />

Then spake the good Sir Siegfried, "Well! let us leave the wood."<br />
His courser bore him smoothly, fast prick'd his comrades good.<br />

Then thus began King Gunther, "This now I needs must ask<br />

Wide was the rule of Etzel, and wider his renown;<br />

Kriemhild at Zeissenmauer remain'd till the fourth day;<br />

When to the monarch's hearing the joyful tidings came.<br />

Good knights of many a region and many a foreign tongue<br />

Chiefs from Greece and Russia in crowds were there to meet;<br />

From Kiev came many a champion, each in fair array,<br />

Fast by the flowing Danube there stands on Austrian ground<br />

Before King Etzel riding his household forward came,<br />

Duke Ramung of Wallachia rode trampling o'er the plain;<br />

Swift Hornbog, with a thousand trampling the dusty green,<br />

Hawart was there of Denmark (a champion bold was he),<br />

His men were like their master, as moody and misproud.<br />
Still on this side Sir Hagan stood ever shouting loud.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XLVII</p>

<p class="verse">
So loud and strong he shouted, that all the water rung,<br />
While the deep-chested warrior thus thunder'd from his tongue,<br />

The same who from this country fled for a mortal feud."<br />

High on his sword an armlet held out the champion bold<br />

He was in sooth, that boatman, an ill-condition'd elf.<br />

With sinewy might the boatman row'd o'er to yonder strand,<br />

With the word up caught he an oar both broad and long,<br />

Aboard then plac'd the heroes their gold and eke their weed.<br />

Hagan was master-boatman; his luckless skill alone<br />

Noble knights a thousand first he ferried o'er,<br />

Then the bold Burgundian the good Sir Gernot spake,<br />

Stoutly swam the chaplain; to 'scape ne'er doubted he,<br />

None there but thought it outrage, yet none came to his aid,<br />

There stood the poor clerk shivering, and shook his dripping weed.<br />

Soon as the bark was emptied, and all the goods it bore<br />

"What are you doing, brother?" Dankwart sudden cried,<br />

From the clouds a moment broke out the gleaming moon;<br />

"You all must until morning ride on as best you can."<br />

<span class="small">HOW IRING WAS SLAIN.</span></h2>


<p class="center">I</p>

<p class="verse">
Then loudly shouted Iring the Danish margrave strong,<br />
"I've shap'd my course in honor, and aim'd at glory long,<br />
And ever have in battle borne me like a knight,<br />
So bring me now my harness, and I'll with Hagan fight."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">II</p>

<p class="verse">
"That I scarce would counsel," in scorn Sir Hagan cried.<br />
"Bid the knights of Hungary stand farther yet aside,<br />
Let two or three together then leap into the hall,<br />
Back wounded down the staircase I'll dash them one and all."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">III</p>

<p class="verse">
"I'll not renounce my challenge," Iring stern replied,<br />
"Ere now have I, and often, such hard adventures tried.<br />
Now sword to sword I'll meet thee; let ruth aside be flung!<br />
What boots thy haughty passion, and valor of the tongue?"<br />
</p>


<p class="center">IV</p>

<p class="verse">
Then at once Sir Iring arm'd him for the fight,<br />
And Irnfried or Thüringia, a young and lusty knight,<br />
And the large-limb'd Hawart with a thousand in his train;<br />
All sought to vouch the quarrel of that redoubted Dane.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">V</p>

<p class="verse">
Soon as the dauntless minstrel so huge a troop espied<br />
Forth all in armor coming on the fierce margrave's side,<br />
Each with his glittering helmet laced ready for the fray,<br />
Somewhat the wrath of Folker kindled at their array.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">VI</p>

<p class="verse">
"See you now, friend Hagan, how comes Sir Iring nigh?<br />
Sure I must condemn him&mdash;ill fits a knight to lie.<br />
To stand against thee singly he promis'd just before,<br />
And now he brings in armor a thousand chiefs or more."<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>


<p class="center">VII</p>

<p class="verse">
"Call me not a liar," Hawart's liegeman cried.<br />
"Yes! I have given a promise; I'd fain my words abide.<br />
I'll ne'er renounce th' adventure; fear is to me unknown;<br />
How fierce soe'er be Hagan, I'll meet him here alone."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">VIII</p>

<p class="verse">
He begg'd his friends and kinsmen, down falling at their feet,<br />
That they would let him singly the stern Burgundian meet.<br />
Fain would they have denied him, for all too well they knew<br />
How stout a knight was Hagan, and how remorseless too.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">IX</p>

<p class="verse">
So long he still entreated, at last they gave consent;<br />
When him on that fierce battle they saw so wildly bent<br />
And so athirst for honor, with grief they let him go.<br />
A deadly strife then follow'd 'twixt either frowning foe.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">X</p>

<p class="verse">
The valiant knight of Denmark bore high his quivering spear,<br />
And crouch'd beneath his buckler through caution, not through fear,<br />
Then, to the hall swift mounting, with Hagan sought to close.<br />
From the death-doing champions a deafening din arose.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XI</p>

<p class="verse">
Each cast his spear at th' other with such o'ermastering might,<br />
Piercing through the strong bucklers e'en to the harness bright,<br />
That the shafts, high whirling, to a distance flew;<br />
Their swords then, sternly frowning, the rival champions drew.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XII</p>

<p class="verse">
Huge was the strength of Hagan, his heart and hand were stout,<br />
Yet on him smote Sir Iring, that rang the hall throughout.<br />
Wall and tower re-echoed at every thundering blow.<br />
Still could not he his purpose work on his burly foe.<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span></p>


<p class="center">XIII</p>

<p class="verse">
So Iring there let Hagan as yet unwounded stand,<br />
And on the warlike minstrel, turn'd at once his hand;<br />
He thought to bring him under with buffets fierce and fell,<br />
But the long-practis'd gleeman his blows all warded well.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XIV</p>

<p class="verse">
Then Folker, kindling passion, smote Iring's buckler so,<br />
That the steel plates which bound it flew off at every blow.<br />
Then turn'd he from the minstrel (he struck too boisterously),<br />
And fell at once on Gunther the King of Burgundy.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XV</p>

<p class="verse">
Then 'twixt the valiant couple a furious strife arose;<br />
King Gunther and Sir Iring, like hail they bandied blows.<br />
Yet the red blood could neither with all his buffets draw,<br />
So goodly was their harness without a fault or flaw.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XVI</p>

<p class="verse">
With that he left King Gunther, and straight at Gernot ran;<br />
The fire from out his mailcoat to hammer he began.<br />
But then to him King Gernot made such a fierce reply,<br />
That the redoubted Iring he all but did to die.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XVII</p>

<p class="verse">
From the prince he bounded; swift the warrior flew;<br />
Four of the Burgundians in a trice he slew,<br />
All high-descended courtiers from Worms across the Rhine;<br />
Well might the youthful Giselher at such a loss repine.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XVIII</p>

<p class="verse">
"Now by heaven, Sir Iring!" in his wrath he said,<br />
"Thy life shall pay the forfeit for those who here lie dead<br />
Through thy remorseless fury."&mdash;He ran at him full fleet,<br />
And smote the Dane so sternly, he could not keep his feet.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XIX</p>

<p class="verse">
Down he dropp'd before him grovelling in the gore;<br />
Sure then ween'd each beholder that he never more<br />
Blow would give or parry on a battle-day;<br />
Yet Iring all unwounded before his foeman lay.<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span></p>


<p class="center"><a name="V35_XX" id="V35_XX"></a><a href="#St_35_XX">XX</a></p>

<p class="verse">
So deep his morion sounded, so loud the sword-stroke clash'd,<br />
His senses were confounded as to the ground he dash'd,<br />
And like a corpse, though living, he lay unconscious there;<br />
So wondrous was the prowess of strong-arm'd Giselher!<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXI</p>

<p class="verse">
When from his brain bewilder'd the swoon had parted slow,<br />
Which had his wits confounded from that o'er mastering blow,<br />
Thought he, "I yet am living, and all unwounded, too.<br />
Now know I Giselher's manhood, and feel what he can do."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXII</p>

<p class="verse">
He heard his foes about him as there he lay o'erthrown;<br />
Worse would he have to suffer if once the truth were known<br />
Well, too, the youthful Giselher perceiv'd he standing by.<br />
Then thought he, from amongst them, by what device to fly.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXIII</p>

<p class="verse">
From the blood he started; pressing was his need;<br />
Sure for his good fortune he might thank his speed.<br />
From the house he darted just where Hagan stood,<br />
And struck at him in passing with all the force he could.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXIV</p>

<p class="verse">
Then thought the Knight of Trony, "Thou'rt in the clutch of death;<br />
Sure, but the devil guard thee, thou canst not 'scape with breath."<br />
Yet with a wound through th' head-piece he straight Sir Hagan paid;<br />
That did the knight with Wasky, his sharp and peerless blade.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXV</p>

<p class="verse">
Soon as fierce Sir Hagan felt the gash and pain,<br />
With his sword uplifted he rush'd upon the Dane.<br />
No more against his fury could Hawart's man make head;<br />
Swift down the stairs Sir Hagan pursued him as he fled.<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span></p>


<p class="center">XXVI</p>

<p class="verse">
Above his head bold Iring held up his buckler strong;<br />
Had that same scanty staircase been full trice as long,<br />
No time had Hagan left him to strike a single stroke.<br />
Ah! what a shower of sparkles red from his morion broke!<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXVII</p>

<p class="verse">
Yet safe and sound Sir Iring came to his friends again.<br />
Soon then were told to Kriemhild th' achievements of the Dane,<br />
And what he unto Hagan had done with his good blade.<br />
Thus unto the warrior her fervent thanks she paid.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXVIII</p>

<p class="verse">
"Now God reward thee, Iring! a noble knight thou art;<br />
Thou hast reviv'd my courage and comforted my heart.<br />
On Hagan's blood-stain'd armor, through thy bold deed, I look."<br />
With her own hand then from him his shield for joy she took.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXIX</p>

<p class="verse">
"Your thanks you'd better husband," said Hagan stern and high,<br />
"'Twould well befit a warrior his chance once more to try.<br />
If then he came back scathless, he'd be indeed a knight.<br />
This scratch will boot you little; so e'en a child could smite.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXX</p>

<p class="verse">
"The blood you see so gladly, which streaks my mail with red,<br />
It but the more provokes me to heap this land with dead.<br />
My strength is undiminish'd, my wrath is now begun;<br />
You'll feel how little mischief to me has Iring done."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXI</p>

<p class="verse">
Iring the Knight of Denmark there stood against the breeze,<br />
Cooling him in his mailcoat, with helm unlaced for ease.<br />
Loud said those about him how bold he was and brave.<br />
Their praise to the good champion the loftiest courage gave.<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>


<p class="center">XXXII</p>

<p class="verse">
Then thus outspoke Sir Iring, "Friends! this for certain know;<br />
Arm me, and delay not; once more I'll prove my foe.<br />
His fierce and haughty bearing I can no longer brook."<br />
His shield was hewn and shatter'd; a better straight he took.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Soon was arm'd the warrior, and better than before;<br />
He shook in wrath and fury the weighty spear he bore;<br />
With this against his foeman with sturdy strides he went.<br />
Hate-sparkling eyes upon him the fierce Sir Hagan bent.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXIV</p>

<p class="verse">
Th' attack of bold Sir Iring he would not there await;<br />
Down the stairs he bounded, and ran upon him straight,<br />
Now darting, and now smiting; his wrath was at the height;<br />
Little then his prowess avail'd the Danish knight.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXV</p>

<p class="verse">
The champions smote so fiercely, that fire-red blasts began<br />
To burn from either buckler; then Hawart's luckless man<br />
So grievously was wounded by Hagan's monstrous main<br />
Through sever'd shield and morion, he ne'er was whole again.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXVI</p>

<p class="verse">
That wound dash'd Iring's courage; he felt him ill bestead;<br />
He rais'd his shield yet higher to guard his bleeding head;<br />
He deem'd it grievous mischief, the wound it was so sore;<br />
Yet at the hand of Hagan had he to suffer more.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXVII</p>

<p class="verse">
A spear the man of Gunther found lying at his feet;<br />
This at the head of Iring he darted sure and fleet,<br />
So that the shaft outjutted, quivering, from his brow.<br />
A fatal end has Hagan made of his foeman now!<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XXXVIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Back to his Danes Sir Iring recoil'd with faltering pace;<br />
Ere from his head his comrades the helmet could unlace,<br />
They broke from it the javelin; then close was death at hand.<br />
His kindred wept around him, a sorrow-laden band.<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span></p>


<p class="center">XXXIX</p>

<p class="verse">
Anon the queen came thither; she o'er the dying bent,<br />
Bewailing dauntless Iring with ghastly dreariment,<br />
And for his wounds sore weeping, and mourning for his sake.<br />
Then thus among his kinsmen the hero faintly spake.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XL</p>

<p class="verse">
"Fair and noble lady! cease for me to grieve.<br />
What avails your weeping? my life I needs must leave;<br />
Yes! the wounds are mortal that thus have pierc'd me through.<br />
Death will not leave me longer to Etzel and to you."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XLI</p>

<p class="verse">
Then thus to each Thüringian he spake, and every Dane,<br />
"Hope not for gifts from Kriemhild, nor count her gold for gain,<br />
For here, my friends! I warn you, e'en with my latest breath,<br />
If once you fight with Hagan, you needs must look on death."<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XLII</p>

<p class="verse">
His lively hue was faded; the stamp of death he bore;<br />
For the redoubted Iring his comrades sorrow'd sore.<br />
Never could recover stout Hawart's vassal true.<br />
Perforce each man of Denmark took to his sword anew.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XLIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Irnfried at once and Hawart both hurried toward the hall<br />
With a thousand warriors; from amongst them all<br />
Loud peal'd the shout of battle; fierce was their wrath and hot.<br />
Ah! what a sleet of javelins at those of Rhine they shot!<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XLIV</p>

<p class="verse">
Upon the valiant gleeman bold Irnfried rush'd amain,<br />
But at his hand destruction was all that he could gain.<br />
A stern man was the minstrel as e'er in field met foe.<br />
Through th' helm he smote the landgrave a deep and deadly blow.<br />
</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span></p>


<p class="center">XLV</p>

<p class="verse">
Sir Irnfried on Sir Folker dealt too a sturdy stroke,<br />
That of his temper'd hauberk the links asunder broke,<br />

Then straight before the minstrel down dropp'd the landgrave dead.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XLVI</p>

<p class="verse">
Sir Hawart and Sir Hagan clos'd too in deadly fight;<br />
Their strife to each beholder was sure a wondrous sight.<br />
Huge strokes from their keen weapons fell thick on either side,<br />
Till by the stern Burgundian perforce Sir Hawart died.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">XLVII</p>

<p class="verse">
When Danes now and Thüringians saw both their leaders slain,<br />
Against the house yet fiercer rush'd on the shouting train.<br />
Loud round the sounding portal the din of battle peal'd,<br />

</p>


<p class="center">XLVIII</p>

<p class="verse">
"Fall back, my friends!" said Folker, "E'en let them enter in,<br />

<p class="center">XLIX</p>

<p class="verse">
Those overweening champions the hall had enter'd now;<br />
Many a proud head among them was sudden taught to bow<br />
Beneath the deadly sword-strokes of the fierce warriors there.<br />
Well fought the valiant Gernot, well, too, young Giselher.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">L</p>

<p class="verse">
A thousand and four together had come into the hall;<br />
You might see the broadswords flashing rise and fall;<br />
Soon the bold intruders all dead together lay;<br />
Of those renown'd Burgundians strange marvels one might say.<br />

<p class="center">LI</p>

<p class="verse">
Thereafter reigned deep silence; the din of war was hush'd;<br />
Through every creak and cranny the blood on all sides gush'd<br />
From that huge hill of slaughter; red did the gutters run.<br />
So much was through their prowess by those of Rhineland done!<br />

<p class="center">LII</p>

<p class="verse">
With that the bold Burgundians sat down awhile to rest.<br />
His bloody sword and buckler down laid each panting guest.<br />
Still stood th' unwearied minstrel on guard the house before,<br />
To watch if any foeman should seek to force the door.<br />
</p>


<p class="center">LIII</p>

<p class="verse">
Sore wail'd the royal Etzel, sore too his lady wept,<br />

"Woe's me," began the margrave, "That ever I was born,<br />

At once his fist he doubled, and fiercely on him ran.<br />

Then turn'd he to Sir Helfrich, and bade him speed his best,<br />

<p class="verse">
The messenger 'gan question, "Why what has here been done?"<br />

"What are the news you bring us?" cried Dietrich at the sight,<br />

A well-approved warrior was master Hildebrand,<br />

<h2 class="p4"><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES"></a>NOTES</h2>


<p>According to Professor Lachmann, this poem has no title in most of the
manuscripts. In the two that have a superscription, it is styled the
Book of Kriemhild. Its ordinary name, The Nibelungenlied, is derived
from the Lassberg manuscript which ends with the words, <i>der Nibelunge
liet</i>, the lay of the Nibelungs, while the better manuscripts for <i>liet</i>
read <i>nôt</i>, calamity. The word Nibelung is a patronymic from <i>nebel</i>,
mist or darkness, and means, child of mist or darkness. Who these
Nibelungs were is involved in appropriate obscurity. In the first part
of the poem, they are Siegfried's Norwegian dependents, formerly
subjects of King Nibelung; in the second, they are the Burgundians,
possibly as being then the possessors of the wondrous treasure. In F.H.
von der Hagen's Remarks on the poem, there is a long rambling note on
this word, a note, however, which is worth reading. The commentator
travels from the Nephilim, or giants of scripture, down to Neville, the
great Earl of Warwick, and his coal-black head of hair. I have followed
Mr. Birch in using the form <i>Nibelunger</i>, as more convenient for the
verse, and more suitable to our language, and also to mark the
difference between the name of an individual, and that of a tribe. For
the same reasons I have ventured to employ the form <i>Amelunger</i>.</p>


<p class="center">FIRST ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_1_VI" id="St_1_VI"></a><a href="#V1_VI">St. VI.</a>) The famous city of Worms derived its name, according to one
tradition, from the <i>Lindwurm</i>, or dragon slain by Siegfried under the
linden tree; according to another, from the multitude of dragons that
infested the neighborhood. The Rose-garden of Kriemhild (which, though
celebrated in other poems, is not noticed in this) was in the vicinity.

<p>It is common in German romances of a certain period for brides to be
carried off by force, and maidens to be wooed by suitors who have never
set eyes on them. See Gervinus's Abridgment of his History of German
poetry. See also the Gudrun.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_3_XXVII" id="St_3_XXVII"></a><a href="#V3_XXVII">St. XXVII.</a>) Lachmann observes on the third verse: "This verse cannot be
explained from our Lays (<i>i.e.</i>, from anything in the poem); the
Netherlanders lost no friend but Siegfried. Is there an allusion to
other legends, or is the departure adorned with the usual coloring?" It
really almost seems as if the writer of this particular stanza had
confounded Nibelungers, Netherlanders and Burgundians all together.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_3_LI" id="St_3_LI"></a><a href="#St_3_LI">St. LI.</a>) Most of the marvels of modern romantic poetry may be traced
back to much older tales reported by Greek authorities. The Scythian
griffins, who watched the treasures coveted by their neighbors the
Arimaspians, the dragon Ladon, who guarded the golden apples of the
Hesperides, the more celebrated bullionist, who kept an eye on the
golden fleece, are the undoubted ancestors of the more modern specimens
of the serpent tribe, who inherited the like miserly passion, and
allured such champions as Siegfried and Orlando to tread in the steps of
Hercules and Jason. The volatile disposition of Wayland the Smith
reminds us of Dædalus; his skill in his art exhibits him as a rival of
Vulcan; his grandfather Wiking, like Ulysses, "<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æquoreas torsit amore
Deas</i>." The Alcinas and Armidas of the modern Italians are only
heightened copies of Calypso and Circe; Siegfried, Orlando and Ferraù,
with their invulnerable hides and superfluous armor, are each of them a
modernized Achilles. This list might be easily lengthened. I am not,
however, aware that the fancy of giving names to swords can be traced to
the classics. Durindana, the sword of Orlando, Fusberta, that of
Rinaldo, Excalibur, of King Arthur, Joyeuse, of Charlemagne, and others,
may be paralleled by the following list from Northern fable, Gram and
Balmung belonging to Siegfried, Mimung to Wayland and Wittich, Nagelring
to Dietrich, Brinnig to Hildebrand, Sachs to Eck, Blutang to Heime,
Schrit to Biterolf, Welsung to Sintram the Greek and Dietlieb, Waske to
Iring, etc. This list is anything but perfect.</p>

<i>kappe</i>, <i>a mantle or cloak</i>, otherwise called <i>nebelkappe</i>, from
<i>nebel</i>, mist, obscurity, was a long and broad mantle, which made the
wearer invisible, and gave him the strength of twelve men. For want of a
better word I have translated it "cloud-cloak."</p>

<i>magetlîchen</i>, not <i>minnelîchen</i>, was the original word; "We have,"
says he rather austerely, "love enough and to spare in St. XXX, Fifth
Adventure;" and certainly, if he be justified in rejecting St. CCXCVIII,
and consequently in putting St. CCXCIX next to St. CCXCVII, there is
rather a superabundance of the tender passion with <i>minnelîchen</i>, in two
successive lines, and <i>minne</i> in a third. On the other hand, it may be
said that this very superabundance is produced by Lachmann's own
rejection of St. CCXCVIII, and that to alter the text of the preceding
stanza in consequence of that rejection, is something like what lawyers
call taking advantage of one's own wrong. But however that may be, it
cannot be denied, that <i>magetlîchen</i> is in St. CCXCVII far more
appropriate than <i>minnelîchen</i>, and its suits my convenience as a
translator infinitely better. I have therefore gladly adopted it.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_6_II" id="St_6_II"></a><a href="#V6_II">St. II.</a>) Lachmann's Fourth Lay begins here, and ends with St. LXXXVIII.
The poem, which we now possess under the name of the Nibelungenlied,
throws into the shade the early history of Siegfried and Brunhild, and
retains only a few obscure allusions to the fact that they were old
acquaintances. See the Preface.</p>

<p><i>Issland</i>, the Kingdom of Brunhild, which I have thus written to
distinguish it from our English word <i>island</i>, is identified by von der
Hagen with Iceland; Wackernagel, in the Glossary to his "Alt-deutsches
Lesebuch" prefers to derive it from <i>Itisland</i> (<i>itis</i>, woman in old
German), the land of women or Amazons. It is however against this
derivation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span> that, though Brunhild was a "Martial Maid" herself, her
kingdom was not a kingdom of Amazons, like that of Radigund in the
"Faerie Queene." Her female attendants were like other women, and her
knights and the officers of her court were of the other sex.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_6_XVI" id="St_6_XVI"></a><a href="#V6_XVI">St. XVI.</a>) In this stanza and those that follow we may clearly discern
that several versions of the same tale have been huddled together. The
same thing may be observed in other parts of the poem, but nowhere so
clearly as here. For the <i>tarnkappe</i> see the note to St. CI.</p>

fishes properly so called.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_7_XII" id="St_7_XII"></a><a href="#V7_XII">St. XII.</a>) The Ballad of Lord Thomas and Fair Annet has something

</div></div>

<p>(<a name="St_7_XVI" id="St_7_XVI"></a><a href="#V7_XVI">St. XVI.</a>) This description of a castle (<i>burc</i>) does not materially
differ from those which occur elsewhere in the poem. The castle was not
one building, however large and complex, but included in the same ample
circuit of its walls several extensive buildings, and afforded
sufficient accommodation for a very great number of persons. The most
conspicuous of the buildings within the castle seem to have been large
detached erections, to which in this poem are applied the words <i>hûs</i>
(house), <i>palas</i> (palace), <i>sal</i> (hall), and <i>gadem</i> (room). In the
passage before us, <i>palas</i> and <i>sal</i> are distinguished from one another;
the same is the case at St. LXXXIV, Twenty-fourth Adventure (<i>palas unde
sal</i>), and at St. XXXVII, Ninth Adventure, where Etzel's and Gunther's
dwellings are respectively spoken of. On the other hand, the hall where
the Burgundians feast with Etzel, and where the repeated conflicts take
place, is called <i>palas</i> at St. XIX, Thirty-sixth Adventure, <i>sal</i> at
St. XX, same Adventure, <i>hûs</i> at St. IX, same Adventure, and <i>gadem</i> at
St. XX, Thirty-ninth Adventure, not to mention other passages; and the
large building in Etzel's castle, where Gunther and his knights sleep,
is called <i>sal</i> at stanzas VII and XVI, <i>hûs</i> at stanzas XV and XVII,
and <i>gadem</i> at St. XIX, of the Thirtieth Adventure. These terms
therefore seem nearly synonymous, or at least equally applicable to the
large detached buildings in question, which resembled our public halls,
such as Westminster hall and Guild-hall, and the halls of colleges and
Inns of Court. Some of the halls in this poem seem to have been of truly
poetical dimensions. Gunther (St. XXVI, of the Thirteenth Adventure)
entertains in his hall twelve hundred knights of Siegfried's, besides
his own Burgundians. Etzel's circle was still more numerous. The
Burgundian knights were more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span> than a thousand in number; Rudeger's five
hundred or more: Dietrich had many a stately man, no doubt the six
hundred mentioned at St. IV, of the Thirty-second Adventure, and we
learn from stanza V, of the Thirty-fourth Adventure, that 7,000 Huns
were massacred by the Burgundians; all these made up a dinner party of
about 9,000 guests. The less aristocratic followers of Gunther, 9,000 in
number, seem also to have been feasting in one immense room, when the
Huns took advantage of their unarmed condition to massacre them. The
term, indeed, applied to the building is <i>hûs</i>, but this, we have seen,
is one of the words used to designate great public halls. The hall,
where Gunther and his knights lay so splendidly (St. IX, Thirtieth
Adventure), seems to have been an Eton Long Chamber on a gigantic scale.
After allowing for the twelve knights with Dankwart and the yeomen, he
must have had more than a thousand warriors in his train. Treachery and
violence were so common in the Middle Ages, that a great man was not
safe except with a multitude of dependents about him, and the peculiar
circumstances of Gunther's case required peculiar precaution. Yet even
Siegfried took a thousand warriors of his own, and a hundred of
Siegmund's, when they went together to visit his brother-in-law. These
large halls were used for feasting, dancing, conversation, and sleeping,
but there were other smaller separate buildings (<i>kemenaten</i>) for the
residence of people of consequence, which no doubt contained several
rooms. These also formed the bowers, or private apartments, of high-born
ladies. The <i>kamere</i> (chamber) seems to have been a room used for all
sorts of purposes, among others for keeping stores and treasure as well
as for living and sleeping. There seem to have been no private chapels
within the walls of the castles described in this poem, none, for
instance, such as St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle, or the chapels
in our Inns of Court and Colleges. Everybody went for his divinity to
the minster. Kriemhild, who was in the habit of going to matins before
daybreak, took her way to the minster, though it was so far from the
castle at Worms that the ladies (St. XXXIV, Thirteenth Adventure) rode
on horseback from one to the other. Gunther's castle was connected with
the city of Worms, but seems to have communicated with the surrounding
country, like the citadels of our present fortified towns. At stanzas
XXXII, XXXIII, Thirteenth Adventure, the ladies view from the castle
windows a tournament held in the country outside the walls. Etzel's
castle, as far as I remember, is not represented as connected with any
town.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_7_XXII" id="St_7_XXII"></a><a href="#V7_XXII">St. XXII.</a>) All this description of the adventurers bears a resemblance
to the passage in the Iliad where Helen points out the Greek chiefs to
Priam; it reminds us also of the imitation of Homer in the "Jerusalem
Delivered."</p>

<p>(<a name="St_7_XXXIV" id="St_7_XXXIV"></a><a href="#V7_XXXIV">St. XXXIV.</a>) Siegfried here seems to apologize to Brunhild for
presenting himself before her.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_7_XLVI" id="St_7_XLVI"></a><a href="#V7_XLVI">St. XLVI.</a>) I cannot understand how the skin could be seen under a
silken surcoat, which was so strong as never to have been cut by weapon,
and which was moreover worn over a breastplate. Lachmann has reason to
say "<i>die Brunne ist vergessen</i>."</p>

stanza (L. St. XLII). What follows between this stanza and St. XLI,
Tenth Adventure (L. St. XXVII, Ninth Adventure) he considers to consist
of two continuations by different authors. Among other matters, they
contain the two marriages of Brunhild and Kriemhild, events which I can
scarcely imagine to have been passed over without notice, though I admit
that they are not related in the clearest manner.</p>


<p class="center">EIGHTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_8_I" id="St_8_I"></a><a href="#V8_I">St. I.</a>) Lachmann observes that this stanza is inconsistent with St.
LXXXIV, Seventh Adventure, where Siegfried is said to have taken the
cloak back to the ship.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_8_XVIII" id="St_8_XVIII"></a><a href="#V8_XVIII">St. XVIII.</a>) Siegfried, I suppose, was not recognized from being in
complete armor, but his shield might have identified him, as in the
battle with the Saxons. Nothing is said here of what he had done with
his <i>tarnkappe</i>.</p>

<p class="center">NINTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_9_I" id="St_9_I"></a><a href="#V9_I">St. I.</a>) According to Lachmann (L. St. XCV, Seventh Adventure) another
continuation begins here. He thinks this addition is by another author
than the composer of the first, and that it resembles in several
respects the Third Lay of his edition, which answers to the Fifth
Adventure ("How Siegfried first saw Kriemhild") of other editions.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_9_III" id="St_9_III"></a><a href="#V9_III">St. III.</a>) Hagan here speaks ironically, but with good nature, as to a
friend. He exhibits the same turn, but with the bitterness that suits
the change of circumstances and the person whom he addresses, in his
dialogues with his enemy Kriemhild, when he meets her in Hungary.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_9_XXVII" id="St_9_XXVII"></a><a href="#V9_XXVII">St. XXVII</a>, Ninth Adventure.) The lady supplies the place of the modern
pocket handkerchief <i>mit snêblanken gêren</i> in the original. The German
<i>gêre</i> is evidently the English <i>gore</i>, a word which puzzled no less a
person than Tyrwhitt, and which Johnson, who writes it <i>goar</i>, has
confounded with the <i>gusset</i>. The latter is the piece under the arm of a
shirt; the gore, as Tyrwhitt was afterward accurately informed by "a
learned person," is a common name for a slip, which is inserted to widen
a garment in any particular part. It is a wedge-shaped piece, as the
German commentators say of their <i>gêre</i>. Shirts at present, however it
may have been in Chaucer's or in Tyrwhitt's time, are not made with
gores; the opening on each side renders gores unnecessary; but in the
female of the shirt and in the smockfrock, gores are, I believe, still
used. The passage in Chaucer illustrates the passage before us. The poet
says of the Carpenter's Wife (Canterbury Tales, 3235)&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span></p><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Upon hire lendes (loins) full of many a gore.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the last line the expression "full of many a gore" means, probably,
full made, spread out by means of many a gore; otherwise "full of gores"
would have been sufficient, and the addition of "many" an inelegant
piece of surplusage. However that may be, it is clear that the apron
stuck out and extended round the person of the wearer in consequence of
the number of these gores, or wedge-shaped pieces, which made the bottom
much wider than the top. An apron, thus made up of a multitude of gores,
might not unaptly be itself called in the plural a woman's gores, and
this seems to have been formerly the case in Germany. Kriemhild is here
said to wipe her eyes with snow-white gores, and, in the Gudrun, the
heroine of that name is rated by the tyrannical Gerlind for wrapping up
her hands indolently in her gores. It is of course impossible for a
translator to render these two passages literally, at least if he wishes
to be intelligible.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_9_XLVIII" id="St_9_XLVIII"></a><a href="#V9_XLVIII">St. XLVIII.</a>) The commentators are not particularly clear as to what
these garments, called in the original "noble Ferrans robes," really
were. Von der Hagan says there must have been a city of that name in the
East, from which these robes came, while Lachmann says there is a stuff
composed of silk and wool, which still goes by the name of <i>ferrandine</i>.
The Dictionary of the French Academy mentions a silk stuff as <i>formerly</i>
going by that name.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_10_LXXXI" id="St_10_LXXXI"></a><a href="#V10_LXXXI">St. LXXXI.</a>) If this and the following stanza are, as Lachmann thinks,
an addition, they no doubt were added to supply a palpable defect in the
narrative. If it were not for them, the company would be spoken of as
rising from table (St. LXXXIV) when it is nowhere mentioned that they
had sat down.</p>

<p>I must venture to remark that Lachmann's note to the next stanza is not
very satisfactory. Though the knights and ladies may usually have eaten
apart, it seems to have been allowable for the mistress of the house at
least to be present when the knights were feasting (St. XXVI, this
Adventure, to St. XXIII, Twenty-seventh Adventure), and there is nothing
unreasonable in supposing that the married sister of the host might have
accompanied her husband. This seems more natural than to assume that the
queens left their apartments and went to the hall (probably a detached
building) just to show themselves before they retired to bed. I must own
I do not see the difficulty about <i>coming</i> and <i>going</i> noticed by
Lachmann. Everybody, who goes to a place, comes to it when he gets
there. As the poem stands, everything is consistent. The queens cross
the palace court and go to the hall for the good substantial reason of
getting their suppers. They come back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span> to their private apartments, or
bowers, where they remain awhile with their immediate attendants, and
during the short interval, that elapses before dismissing the latter and
going to bed, Siegfried slips through his wife's fingers, and goes to
Gunther's private apartments.</p>

<p>I should add that, at St. XXIV, Twenty-seventh Adventure, the young
margravine and her damsels are brought back into the eating hall after
the men have finished their repast, but that depends on the correctness
of the reading <i>die sch&#339;nen</i> (<a href="#St_27_XXXI">see note</a> to St. XXXI, Twenty-seventh
Adventure) and on the consequent expulsion of the latter stanza. If we
retain the latter stanza, the young margravine is sent for <i>ze hove</i>,
like Kriemhild at St. XXXI, Tenth Adventure. But we can scarcely apply
to young married women and their near female connections, also married,
passages like these, that relate to young spinsters. In the passages
quoted in the note to St. XXIV, Twenty-seventh Adventure, men and women
are mentioned as eating apart, but it is stated to be an old custom, and
is noted as an ancient peculiarity.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_10_LXXXV" id="St_10_LXXXV"></a><a href="#V10_LXXXV">St. LXXXV</a>, Tenth Adventure.) It appears from this description that the
wearer of the cloak must have had the power of being visible or
invisible as he chose. He might have on the mantle, and yet be visible.
Siegfried does not here leave his wife in the ordinary way, and then put
on the cloak. He seems to disappear miraculously. This differs from the
account given in stanzas XLIII, Seventh Adventure, and LXXXIV, of the
same, where Siegfried puts on the cloak before he becomes invisible, and
remains so till he puts it off, but agrees with St. XXI, Nineteenth
Adventure, where it is distinctly stated that Siegfried wore the cloak
at all times. I should however add that, in the original, there is what
appears to my ignorance a difficulty, though, as the commentators take
no notice of it, I suppose there is really none. The original stands
thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sî trûte sîne hende mit ir vil wîzen hant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unz er vor ir augen, sine wesse wenne, verswant,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>literally, "She fondled his hands with her very white hand, till he
before her eyes, she knew not when, vanished." As to the interpreters,
Braunfels simply modernizes the old dialect, rendering <i>wenne</i> by
<i>wann</i>; Simrock and Marbach are equally literal, except that they put
<i>wie</i>, how, where Braunfels has <i>wann</i>; Beta, who here as elsewhere is
less rigorously literal than his comrades, merely says, "then it
happened that he suddenly vanished before her sight." I must confess I
cannot understand how Kriemhild could not know <i>when</i> a thing happened
that passed before her eyes, though she might well be puzzled how to
account for it. It is remarkable that the Lassberg manuscript, which is
said by Lachmann and other competent judges to contain a revised and
remodelled text, omits altogether St. LXXXVI, Tenth Adventure, and
alters the stanza before it, and that after it in such a way, that the
supernatural seems to disappear, and Siegfried is merely represented as
stealing away from the women, and coming secretly and mysteriously (<i>vil
tougen</i>) to Gunther's chamber. This manuscript however mentions the
tarnkappe at St. LXXVII, same Adventure. Did the reviser of this
manuscript wish it to be inferred, that Siegfried, after leaving his
wife, went and put on the tarnkappe?</p>

<p>(<a name="St_10_CX" id="St_10_CX"></a><a href="#V10_CX">St. CX.</a>) In the Volsunga Saga Brunhild is a Valkyrie, or Chooser of the
Slain, a sort of Northern Bellona, endowed with supernatural strength.
This superhuman prowess is connected with her virgin state, and by
becoming a wife she is reduced to the ordinary weakness of woman. In the
Nibelungenlied this circumstance comes upon us by surprise, for we are
nowhere told that the strength of Brunhild differed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span> from that of other
women, except in degree, and no reason is given why matrimony should
produce any greater change in Brunhild than in the rest of her sex. The
passage is in fact derived from the Scandinavian form of the legend, and
seems scarcely in harmony with the spirit of the German poem.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_12_LIV" id="St_12_LIV"></a><a href="#V12_LIV">St. LIV.</a>) A difference of opinion exists in united Germany as to the
interpretation of this passage, Lachmann, Simrock, Marbach, and Beta
being on one side, and von der Hagen and Braunfels on the other. I
readily vote with the majority. Rumolt's understrappers, as I conceive,
are not the pots and pans, but the subaltern cooks, the scullions and
other drudges of the royal kitchen.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_13_II" id="St_13_II"></a><a href="#V13_II">St. II.</a>) I follow Lachmann's conjecture of <i>het</i> for <i>heten</i> in the
third line of this stanza.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The comparison of the brilliant color of a blooming northern beauty to
gold, "red gold," as it is constantly called in old German and old
English poetry, forms a curious contrast with the phrases of Catullus,
"<i>inaurata pallidior statua</i>" "<i>magis fulgore expalluit, auri</i>," and
that of Statius, "<i>pallidus fossor redit erutoque concolor auro</i>," not
to mention the saying of Diogenes, that gold was pale through fear of
those who had a design upon it.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_13_XXIII" id="St_13_XXIII"></a><a href="#V13_XXIII">St. XXIII.</a>) Lachmann interprets the <i>gesinde</i> or followers to be
Gunther's, and rejects the stanza as spurious, and manufactured for the
purpose of introducing Dankwart, who is represented as seeking out new
quarters, without necessity, for people who were already quartered in
the city. But are not the followers of Siegfried meant?</p>

<p>(<a name="St_13_XXVII" id="St_13_XXVII"></a><a href="#V13_XXVII">St. XXVII.</a>) A curious instance of awkwardness in the service of the
highest tables.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_13_XXXII" id="St_13_XXXII"></a><a href="#V13_XXXII">St. XXXII.</a>) The original has in the first verse <i>in dem lande</i>, in the
country, <i>i.e.</i>, just outside the city walls, close under the castle,
from the windows of which the ladies might see the tournament. The
minster was in a separate part of the city, just as in London St. Paul's
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span> at a certain distance from the Tower. Here the horses are sent for,
which seems to show that the castle and the minster could not have been
contiguous, yet they could not have been very far apart, as Kriemhild
was in the habit of going to the minster before daybreak. (St. III,
Seventh Adventure.)</p>


<p class="center">FOURTEENTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_14_IV" id="St_14_IV"></a><a href="#V14_IV">St. IV.</a>) The same simile is applied to Kriemhild herself at St. XX,
Fifth Adventure.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_14_XXX" id="St_14_XXX"></a><a href="#V14_XXX">St. XXX.</a>) In the dialogues that follow the queens are not particularly
complimentary, but they at least use no weapons but their tongues. I do
not know what authority the writer of "Murray's Handbook for Northern
Germany" has for the following statement. "The combat between Chrimhelda
and Brunhelda is supposed to have been fought on the south side of the
Dom."</p>

<p>(<a name="St_14_XXIII" id="St_14_XXIII"></a><a href="#V14_XXIII">St. XXIII.</a>) Wind, a mere nothing; this phrase is not uncommon in the
poem.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>(<a name="St_14_XL" id="St_14_XL"></a><a href="#V14_XL">St. XL.</a>) Brunhild had been asserting that Siegfried was Gunther's
vassal, or, in feudal language, his man. Kriemhild sarcastically alludes
to this with more bitterness than delicacy.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_14_XLI" id="St_14_XLI"></a><a href="#V14_XLI">St. XLI.</a>) Brunhild seems as much annoyed by this usurpation of her
trinkets as by the scandalous imputation mentioned in the preceding
stanza.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_14_L" id="St_14_L"></a><a href="#V14_L">St. L.</a>) I have followed Professor Lachmann's explanation of the first
line of this stanza. He makes the Seventh Lay open here, and end with
St. XXXI, Fifteenth Adventure, but whatever we may think of his general
theory of the poem, his prefatory remarks here are well worth an
attentive perusal. It is clear that some stanzas, probably a good many,
have been lost. As the work stands at present, even if we interpret the
first line of this stanza to mean that many a fair woman departed,
Siegfried is left behind to hear his brother-in-law and his friends
discuss the expediency of knocking him on the head. In the part that is
lost there was probably an account of the breaking up of the assemblage
at the church door, and of the immediate summoning of a council in some
more convenient place. It was no doubt explained how Siegfried's denial,
which at first seemed so satisfactory, was afterward made of no account,
and possibly a good deal, of which we have now only a fragment in
stanzas L&mdash;LI, passed between Brunhild and Hagan, her husband's
principal adviser. Probably, too, as Lachmann has observed, the
invulnerability of Siegfreid was considered.</p>


<p class="center">FIFTEENTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_15_XVIII" id="St_15_XVIII"></a><a href="#V15_XVIII">St. XVIII.</a>) The stanza, which contains this example of ancient
discipline, is rejected by Lachmann on account of the <i>innere reim</i>,
which, however, he thinks, suits perfectly with the "somewhat
over-charged coloring" which the author has adopted. Pictures of
domestic happiness in the same style of coloring are, I suppose, rarely
to be met with in Germany in the present liberal and enlightened age.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_15_XXXVI" id="St_15_XXXVI"></a><a href="#V15_XXXVI">St. XXXVI.</a>) The Wask forest is the mountainous range called in French
the Vosges, which, as well as Worms, is to the west of the Rhine; this
stanza is therefore at variance with St. I, Seventeenth Adventure, where
the hunters cross the Rhine to return to Worms. Lachmann gets over the
difficulty by his theory of separate lays. According<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span> to his arrangement
St. XXXVI, this Adventure, is in the Seventh Lay, and St. I, Seventeenth
Adventure, in the Eighth, and these two Lays are the work of different
poets. Two points are certain; the first, that there were two traditions
as to the place of Siegfried's death, one fixing it in the Waskenwald,
the other in the Odenwald; the second, that Gunther and Hagan were
generally believed to have attacked Walter of Spain in the Waskenwald.
Now there appears to me nothing improbable in supposing, either that a
minstrel with his head full of Walter's history and the connection of
Gunther and Hagan with the Waskenwald, might have recited <i>Waskenwalde</i>
for <i>Otenwalde</i>, or, on the other hand, that one, who was familiar with
the tradition that Siegfried was killed in the Odenwald, might have
found <i>an den Rîn</i> at St. XXXVII, Sixteenth Adventure, and altered it to
<i>über Rîn</i>. At any rate I cannot help thinking that either of these
suppositions is less improbable than that a poet should first tell us
how Gunther and Hagan plotted against Siegfried, how the latter accepted
their treacherous invitation to the hunt, and how he went to take leave
of his wife, and that then the provoking rogue should immediately close
his poem without informing us what passed between Siegfried and his
wife, whether the hunt took place, or whether the plot succeeded.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_16_XXXVIII" id="St_16_XXXVIII"></a><a href="#V16_XXXVIII">St. XXXVIII.</a>) For the sweetness of "the panther's breath or rather
body" I refer the reader to Gifford's note in his edition of Ben Jonson,
v. 3, p. 257. It is worth while however to quote the following passage
on panthers from Pliny's Natural History, 1. 8, c. 17, as it is not
noticed by Gifford. "<i>Ferunt odore earum mire sollicitari quadrupedes
cunctas, sed capitis torvitate terreri; quamobrem, occultato eo, reliqua
dulcedine invitatas corripiunt.</i>"</p>

<p>(<a name="St_16_XXXIX" id="St_16_XXXIX"></a><a href="#V16_XXXIX">St. XXXIX.</a>) I scarcely know whether I have translated this stanza
properly. The variegated work (expressed by <i>geströut</i> in the original)
seems to have been produced by different sorts of fur. The <i>grâ unde
bunt</i> of St. XVI, Third Adventure, seems to mean the same thing. Gold
thread or wire, and something like gold lace appear to have been
fashionable ornaments in the dress of both sexes. Precious stones, too,
were in great request. But I own I have been much puzzled by the
milliners' and tailors' work in the poem, and I dare say have made
mistakes. I may observe that the women were both tailors and milliners.
Kriemhild herself was an accomplished cutter (see St. XLIV, Sixth
Adventure), and, if it had not been for her assistance, her brother and
his companions would not have been fit to be seen at the splendid court
of Brunhild. The men were expert cutters in their line, but their
instrument was the broadsword.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span></p>

<p>(<a name="St_16_XL" id="St_16_XL"></a><a href="#V16_XL">St. XL.</a>) In this poem the edges of a sword are constantly spoken of in
the plural. The warriors seem to have had only two-edged swords.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_16_LIV" id="St_16_LIV"></a><a href="#V16_LIV">St. LIV.</a>) The fourth line of this stanza, which is admitted as genuine
by Professor Lachmann, is one of those passages which are at variance
not merely with his theory, but with that which attributes the two parts
of the poem to two different authors. It refers to the slaughter toward
the close of the second part, and would be impertinent and out of place
in a poem that concluded with the death of one hero only.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_16_LVIII" id="St_16_LVIII"></a><a href="#V16_LVIII">St. LVIII.</a>) The poet says <i>the</i> broad linden, according to Lachmann,
assuming that the story of Siegfried's death under a linden tree was
generally known.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_17_II" id="St_17_II"></a><a href="#V17_II">St. II.</a>) Lachmann's Ninth Lay begins here and ends with St. LXXI,
Seventeenth Adventure. The Professor has no objection to considering
this and the preceding Lay as works of the same author.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_17_IX" id="St_17_IX"></a><a href="#V17_IX">St. IX.</a>) The two last lines of this stanza and the two first of the
next are rejected by Professor Lachmann, because, as he thinks, they
contradict the last line of St. XI, where Kriemhild professes her
ignorance of the murderer. But Kriemhild is not a witness on oath, but a
woman in a frenzy of grief, who does not weigh her words, but one moment
utters an obvious suspicion, as if it were an ascertained fact, and the
next confesses that she has no positive proof, and cannot act upon what
she feels to be true. There is no very great inconsistency in saying,
"A. and B. are at the bottom of this: if I could only bring it home to
them, I'd make them smart for it." But the neuter pronoun in the third
line, referring to <i>houbet</i> in the second, proves that the second line
is not interpolated. Professor Lachmann, indeed, gets over the
difficulty by altering the gender of the pronoun to the masculine.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_17_XI" id="St_17_XI"></a><a href="#V17_XI">St. XI.</a>) The last verse of this stanza seems a preparation for the
display of Kriemhild's character in a new point of view. The softer
parts of her character have been exhibited thus far; her revengeful and
unforgiving spirit will gradually swallow up every other feeling, and at
last close the poem with a general massacre. See, too, stanzas
XXIII&mdash;XXXII&mdash;XLV.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_17_XXI" id="St_17_XXI"></a><a href="#V17_XXI">St. XXI.</a>) I have translated the second line of this stanza according to
Simrock's version, but it is impossible to make any satisfactory sense
of it. Professor Lachmann has justly printed the stanza in italics.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_17_XLIII" id="St_17_XLIII"></a><a href="#V17_XLIII">St. XLIII.</a>) On this curious superstition, which is as much English and
Scotch as German, see Nare's Glossary under the word "Wounds," and the
notes to "Earl Richard" in the second volume of the "Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border." The whole passage is condemned as spurious by
Lachmann, principally on account of the discrepancy in the mention of
wounds in the plural, while only one wound was given by Hagan. There
are, however, two similar discrepancies in the poem. Kriemhild is killed
by Hildebrand apparently with a single blow, and immediately after is
spoken of as hewn in pieces; and Rudeger is killed by a single blow at
St. XXXVII, Thirty-seventh Adventure, while at St. L, same Adventure, he
is described as <i>verhouwen</i>, and at St. XXXII, Thirty-eighth Adventure,
as lying with severe death-wounds fallen in blood.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span></p>

<p>(<a name="St_19_XXI" id="St_19_XXI"></a><a href="#V19_XXI">St. XXI.</a>) This passage, which states that Siegfried wore the
cloud-cloak at all times, agrees with the description of its mode of
operation at St. LXXXV, Tenth Adventure, but is inconsistent with
stanzas XLIII-LXXXIV, Seventh Adventure, from which last it would seem
to have been necessary for Siegfried to put on the cloak in order to
become invisible, and to put it off when he wished to become visible
again. The inconsistent passages probably arose from varying traditions
as to the operation of this miraculous garment. There is another
difficulty here. From Alberic's words it would seem that the possession
of the treasure depended on the possession of the cloud-cloak. If he and
his fellows had not lost the cloak <i>together with Siegfried</i> (by which
last words he seems to refer not to the original loss of the cloak, when
Siegfried first won it, but to its loss in consequence of that hero's
death), the Burgundians should not have had the treasure, but we are
nowhere told what became of the cloak after Siegfried's death, and
Kriemhild claims the treasure as a gift from Siegfried, not as depending
on the possession of the cloak.</p>


<p class="center">TWENTIETH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_I" id="St_20_I"></a><a href="#V20_I">St. I.</a>) Lachmann's Eleventh Lay begins here, and ends with St. III,
Twenty-first Adventure. "The historical relation of Etzel to Attila,"
says Professor W. Grimm ("Deutsche Heldensage," p. 67), "is quite
clear." It is here strengthened by the "mention of his brother
Bl&#339;delin, who answers to the Bleda of Priscus and Jornandes, and is
found in the Klage, in Biterolf, in the Vilkina Saga, and other later
poems. Helche, otherwise Erka, Herche, Herriche, and Hariche, reminds us
of the Kerka of Priscus." Priscus was secretary to Maximin, the
ambassador of Theodosius the Younger at the court of Attila, and wrote a
history, of which extracts are still extant. The following is his
account of an interview with Kerka, the "<i>frou Helche</i>" of our poem.

Gibbon in the 34th chapter of his
History has given almost a translation of Priscus. "The wife of Attila
received their visit sitting, or rather lying, on a soft couch; the
floor was covered with a carpet; the domestics formed a circle round the
queen, and her damsels, seated on the ground, were employed in working
the variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the barbaric
warriors." There is a full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span> account of Attila and the Huns with much
relating to the Nibelungenlied in the late Hon. and Rev. William
Herbert's Historical Treatise subjoined to his Poem on Attila.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_V" id="St_20_V"></a><a href="#V20_V">St. V.</a>) The Margrave Rudeger is perhaps the most interesting character
in the poem, but there is no one, with regard to whom the historical,
the legendary, and the mythical are more unintelligibly jumbled. Whether
he was an historical Austrian Margrave of the tenth century, a mere
legendary hero, or "a divine being," as Lachmann is disposed to think
him, is more than any plain Englishman can venture to decide. It seems
that his native country was Arabia, but whether by that name is meant
the region commonly so called, or a district in the centre of Spain, is
as yet anything but a settled point. Wherever it was, he was driven from
it by a king of Toledo, and took refuge with Etzel.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_XX" id="St_20_XX"></a><a href="#V20_XX">St. XX.</a>) I am uncertain whether I have given the true meaning of this
stanza, which is rejected by Lachmann, and, indeed, can scarcely be
reconciled with the rest. I have used <i>Hun</i> and <i>Hungarian</i>
indifferently. The Hungarians were of a different race from the Huns,
but Mr. Hallam says of them, "The memory of Attila was renewed in the
devastations of these savages, who, if they were not his compatriots,
resembled them both in their countenances and customs."</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_XXXI" id="St_20_XXXI"></a><a href="#V20_XXXI">St. XXXI.</a>) See Lachmann (St. 1113, L.) who conjectures <i>ersiwet</i> for
<i>erfüllet</i> or <i>ir sulet</i>.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_XLVII" id="St_20_XLVII"></a><a href="#V29_XLVII">St. XLVII.</a>) This refers to something not related in this poem.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_LIX" id="St_20_LIX"></a><a href="#V20_LIX">St. LIX.</a>) Here again is an allusion to something not mentioned in the
poem, namely, to some service rendered by Rudeger to Hagan.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_LXIV" id="St_20_LXIV"></a><a href="#V20_LXIV">St. LXIV.</a>) The poet, who put this speech into the mouth of Gunther,
could have had no notion of the real history and extensive power of
Attila.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_CXX" id="St_20_CXX"></a><a href="#V20_CXX">St. CXX.</a>) King Etzel appears to have been a truly liberal and
enlightened monarch.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_20_CXLV" id="St_20_CXLV"></a><a href="#V20_CXLV">St. CXLV.</a>) In the last line of this stanza, the plural of the verb is
authorized by three manuscripts, and, though they may be none of the
best, their readings deserve attention, when they are commanded by
necessity and common sense. The plural (<i>in</i> for <i>ihnen</i>) in the
preceding line requires the plural in this. The young ladies cried at
leaving home, but were soon reconciled to their lot by the gayeties of
King Etzel's court. If the reader is not satisfied with this, he can
replace <i>they</i> by <i>she</i>. Kriemhild will then be meant.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_21_VII" id="St_21_VII"></a><a href="#V21_VII">St. VII.</a>) This good bishop Pilgrin, who is an historical personage,
died in the tenth century, and therefore could scarcely have been
Attila's wife's uncle, if chronology is to pass for anything with
popular poets. All that relates to him is rejected as spurious by
Lachmann and W. Grimm. See the latter's "Deutsche Heldensage," p. 71.</p>

<p class="center">TWENTY-SECOND ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_22_XIII" id="St_22_XIII"></a><a href="#V22_XIII">St. XIII.</a>) Lachmann rejects stanzas XIII, XVI, XVII (1288, 1291, 1292
of his edition). He thinks that, even if one were determined to defend
the first, nobody could tolerate the frigidity and abject style of the
two last. For my own part, I am more struck by the absurdity of
Rudeger's caution to Kriemhild not to kiss all Etzel's men. I suppose he
was afraid she would have no lips left after such reiterated osculation.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_22_XIX" id="St_22_XIX"></a><a href="#V22_XIX">St. XIX.</a>) These German strangers or guests (<i>Tiuschen gesten</i>) are the
Burgundians according to von der Hagen, but Thüringians according to
Lachmann. The latter says, the expression does not occur elsewhere in
the Lays of the Nibelungers. This restricted use of a term, which was
afterward extended to a whole nation, resembles the restricted use of
the word Hellen in Homer.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_22_XXIII" id="St_22_XXIII"></a><a href="#V22_XXIII">St. XXIII.</a>) The good margrave seems here to discharge the duties of a
male duenna.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_22_XL" id="St_22_XL"></a><a href="#V22_XL">St. XL.</a>) Von der Hagen here notices the custom of tilting by the way in
festal processions. Similar descriptions occur elsewhere in this poem,
as for instance at the landing of Gunther and Brunhild (St. VII, Tenth
Adventure). In this respect the Nibelungenlied differs from the "Orlando
Innamorato" and "Furioso," as well as from the "Faerie Queene," in all
of which poems tournaments are exhibited with far more pomp and
ceremony, and as matters of long previous preparation.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_22_XLI" id="St_22_XLI"></a><a href="#V22_XLI">St. XLI.</a>) Haimburg, a town of Hungary on the borders of Austria, was
fortified, according to von der Hagen, by Duke Leopold, of Austria, out
of the ransom of Richard C&#339;ur de Lion.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_22_XLIV" id="St_22_XLIV"></a><a href="#V22_XLIV">St. XLIV.</a>) Etzel's castle, now Buda, so called from Attila's brother,

<p>(<a name="St_24_LXIII" id="St_24_LXIII"></a><a href="#V24_LXIII">St. LXIII.</a>) This stanza seems out of its place here. It should come
somewhere before the council of the Burgundian chiefs, for it is
necessary to know when an entertainment is to take place in order to
determine whether one can attend it, and when one ought with propriety
to set out. Hagan, besides, must be considered to have had a knowledge
of this, before he arranged the plan of setting out only a week after
the departure of the ambassadors.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_25_II" id="St_25_II"></a><a href="#V25_II">St. II.</a>) Lachmann's Fourteenth Lay begins here and ends with St. LVI,
Twenty-sixth Adventure.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_25_XVIII" id="St_25_XVIII"></a><a href="#V25_XVIII">St. XVIII.</a>) This is the only stanza in the second part where the term
Nibelunger is applied to Siegfried's subjects as in the first part. In
all succeeding passages it means the Burgundians.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_25_XIX" id="St_25_XIX"></a><a href="#V25_XIX">St. XIX.</a>) Ostervranken, according to von der Hagen, is Austrasia, or
the Eastern portion of the Empire of the Franks, afterward, though in a
more restricted sense, the Circle of Franconia.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_25_XXIII" id="St_25_XXIII"></a><a href="#V25_XXIII">St. XXIII.</a>) Professor Lachmann observes that, if the fight with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span> the
Bavarians be not alluded to, the prediction contained in this stanza is
not fulfilled, "quite against the prophetic style of this lay;" but I
venture to submit that this is no prediction at all, but a mere
expression of the very natural opinion that, if any army should attempt
to swim a large river in a state of flood, many may be swept away and
drowned. Gernot makes a similar remark on the want of a boatman at St.
LXIV.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_25_XXIX" id="St_25_XXIX"></a><a href="#V25_XXIX">St. XXIX.</a>) The raiment of these mermaids, which is styled <i>wondrous</i>
farther on, seems to have been the swan-raiment worn by the Valkyries or
Choosers of the Slain, which enabled its wearers to assume the shape of
swans, or at least to fly away. Hagan therefore had good ground to begin
with laying hands on the wardrobe of these water-nymphs, though his
reason for doing so is so obscurely alluded to in the poem that it may
be doubted whether the poet was himself aware of the original force of
the legend. In the traditions respecting Vælund, Wieland, or Wayland the
Smith, that hero captures a wife by a similar stratagem. The swan-maiden
in Wieland's case was one of the Valkyries, and indeed the two mermaids
in the Nibelungenlied appear, from the part assigned to them in the
poem, to be genuine Choosers of the Slain. These swan-maidens, as far as
their volatile character is concerned, seem to have given a hint to the
author of Peter Wilkins.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_25_XLVIII" id="St_25_XLVIII"></a><a href="#V25_XLVIII">St. XLVIII.</a>) So in the old lay of Hildebrand (a fragment of which,
written on the first and on the last leaf of a manuscript of the "Book
of Wisdom" and other religious pieces, was discovered in the public
library of Cassel by W. Grimm) that hero offers arm-rings to his son,
who, not knowing him, had challenged him to fight. It was the custom to
offer such rings on the point of a sword or spear, and to receive them
in the same way. To prove this, W. Grimm quotes this passage among
others. See Lachmann's treatise on the "Lay of Hildebrand" in the
Transactions of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, 1833. The same word
(<i>bouc</i>) is used both here and in the old lay.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_25_LXVII" id="St_25_LXVII"></a><a href="#V25_LXVII">St. LXVII.</a>) This stanza, which appears in only two manuscripts, seems
incompatible with the rest of the narrative. It was probably introduced
by a reciter from the description of a ferry-boat in some other poem.</p>

<p>The German poem is here certainly not inferior to the Greek. Similes are
as rare in the Nibelungenlied as they are abundant in the Iliad, but it

<p class="center">TWENTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_27_XXIV" id="St_27_XXIV"></a><a href="#V27_XXIV">St. XXIV.</a>) I quote some passages from Ellis's "Specimens" on the custom
of the two sexes eating apart:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The king was to his palace, tho the service was ydo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ylad with all his menye, and the queen to hers also,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Robert of Gloucester.&mdash;"Specimens," vol. i. p. 100.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The above metre, though very rough and uncouth, resembles that of the
Nibelungenlied. In the corresponding passage quoted by Ellis from
Geoffry of Monmouth, the custom is said to have come from Troy.
"<i>Antiquam consuetudinem Trojæ servantes Britones consueverant mares cum
maribus, mulieres cum mulieribus, festivos dies separatim celebrare.</i>"
Ellis gives a similar account of Arthur's coronation from Robert de
Brunne's translation of Wace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sometime was custom of Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they made feast of joy,<br /></span>

<p>(<a name="St_27_XXXI" id="St_27_XXXI"></a><a href="#V27_XXXI">St. XXXI.</a>) There is a difficulty here from its being said that the
young margravine was desired to go to court, <i>i.e.</i>, to the assembly in
the hall, when at St. XXIV the ladies (<i>die schönen</i> in the original)
had already returned thither. Lachmann removes the difficulty by
condemning the stanzas XXXI, XXXII, XXXIV as spurious; he thinks it
impossible that anyone can collect from the third line of St. XXII that
the men went into a different hall from that which they had entered at
St. XIX; but it is not the third but the second line of St. XXII that
describes the separation of the men and women, and that too in the
following words,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>"Rittere unde vrouwen die giengen anderswâ</i>;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>now who can collect from this verse that the women went and the men
stayed? If words mean anything, both went away. As to the return of the
ladies at St. XXIV, that rests on a doubtful reading, <i>die schönen</i>, the
fair ones, whereas the best manuscript, that on which Professor
Lachmann's text is generally founded, reads <i>die künen</i>, the bold ones,
meaning the knights. I should add that the preliminary conversation from
St. XXV to St. XXXI is fitter to be held in the young lady's absence.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_27_XLIV" id="St_27_XLIV"></a><a href="#V27_XLIV">St. XLIV.</a>) These foreign champions are the Burgundians themselves
according to von der Hagen. This is far from satisfactory, but I can
offer nothing more so. Can it be possible that there was once a version
(now lost) of the story, in which the Nibelungers, properly so called,
accompanied the Burgundians into Hungary? This might account not merely
for these foreign champions, but for the term <i>Nibelunge</i> being applied
to the Burgundians. But, in fact, everything relating to the Nibelungers
is obscure and confused to the last degree.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_27_L" id="St_27_L"></a><a href="#V27_L">St. L.</a>) Nudung was the son, or, according to another account, the
brother of Gotelind.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_27_LXVI" id="St_27_LXVI"></a><a href="#V27_LXVI">St. LXVI.</a>) Lachmann transposes this and the two following stanzas to
after St. XVI, Twenty-eighth Adventure, where they form the beginning of
his Sixteenth Lay, which ends with St. XLIV, Twenty-ninth Adventure. The
speech which begins at the third line of this stanza is attributed to
the messenger by von der Hagen, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span> perhaps justly, as appears from the
last verse of the next stanza, from which it would seem that the king
heard the news afterward. On the other hand, Kriemhild here is addressed
in the singular, while in a similar passage (St. XCI, Fourth Adventure)
she is addressed by a messenger in the plural. She, however, would
scarcely have uttered before Etzel the words at the close of St. LXVIII,
Twenty-seventh Adventure.</p>


<p class="center">TWENTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_I" id="St_28_I"></a><a href="#V28_I">St. I.</a>) Bern is Verona according to von der Hagen and Wackernagel and
the whole body of Commentators. Von der Hagen applies to Hildebrand the
words in the third line, <i>ez was im harte liet</i>; so does Marbach.
Braunfels and Beta apply them to Dietrich. But in that case would not
the author have said <i>dem was ez</i>?</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_IV" id="St_28_IV"></a><a href="#V28_IV">St. IV.</a>) The Amelungs, or Amelungers, were the reputed descendants of
Amala, king of the Goths, the tenth ancestor of Theodoric king of Italy.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_V" id="St_28_V"></a><a href="#V28_V">St. V.</a>) This famous hero, the redoubted Dietrich, is only a secondary
character in the Nibelungenlied, though in old German traditions
generally he bears the principal part. He was the son of a nocturnal
spirit, and his fiery breath made him more than a match for Siegfried
himself, as it melted the horny hide of his antagonist. He is
identified, I believe, by universal consent, with Theodoric the
Ostrogoth. I am afraid that it is too certain that he came to a bad end,
but whether he disappeared on being summoned by a dwarf, or was carried
off by the devil in the shape of a black horse, or, according to the
monastic legend reported by Gibbon, was deposited by foul fiends in the
volcano of Libari, is more than I can decide.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_XX" id="St_28_XX"></a><a href="#V28_XX">St. XX.</a>) Lachmann's Seventeenth Lay begins here and ends with St.
XXXII, Thirtieth Adventure.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_XXI" id="St_28_XXI"></a><a href="#V28_XXI">St. XXI.</a>) Hagan's suspicions are natural enough, for Kriemhild appears
to have kissed nobody but Giselher, whereas, according to the etiquette
of this poem, she should not only have kissed her other two brothers,
but Hagan himself, not merely as her cousin, but as one of Gunther's
principal retainers.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_XXVI" id="St_28_XXVI"></a><a href="#V28_XXVI">St. XXVI.</a>) This stanza is rejected by Lachmann on account of the
interior rhyme <i>wære</i> and <i>swære</i> in the third and fourth lines, but
surely the outbreak of Hagan in the next stanza is the beginning of a
speech. It would have been more plausible, if St. VIII is to be
rejected, to reject St. XXI, Thirtieth Adventure, as well, for the first
line of St. XXVII would come in very well after the last of St. XXIV;
but then, on the other hand, no answer would be given to Kriemhild's
question, "Where have you that bestowed?"</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_XXVII" id="St_28_XXVII"></a><a href="#V28_XXVII">St. XXVII.</a>) The two languages agree in taking the devil's name in vain
by using it as a ludicrous but forcible negative. The phrase is
authorized by Johnson.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_XXVIII" id="St_28_XXVIII"></a><a href="#V28_XXVIII">St. XXVIII.</a>) Von der Hagen explains these two robberies by observing
that Hagan had despoiled Kriemhild of her own inheritance as well as of
the wondrous hoard. The poem itself, however, seems to explain the
matter somewhat differently. Hagan committed the first robbery when he
took the hoard (St. XXXV, Nineteenth Adventure); the second, when he
seized Siegfried's other treasures (St. CXXXII, Twentieth Adventure).</p>

<p>(<a name="St_28_XXXIV" id="St_28_XXXIV"></a><a href="#V28_XXXIV">St. XXXIV.</a>) Lachmann places this and the following stanzas after St.
XIX, as part of his Sixteenth Lay.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span></p>


<p class="center">TWENTY-NINTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_29_I" id="St_29_I"></a><a href="#V29_I">St. I.</a>) Von der Hagen discovers here (v. 7055 of his Remarks) a trace
of the tradition (which, however, is not noticed in this poem) that
Hagan had lost an eye. This appears visionary to me. At St. XVII,
Thirty-second Adventure, the same words are applied to Dankwart, who
certainly had two eyes in his head. Twice in this poem a personal
description of Hagan occurs (St. XXV, Seventh Adventure, and XVII,
Twenty-eighth Adventure) and in neither case is a hint given that he was
a <i>dux luscus</i>. The author or authors of the Nibelungenlied, therefore,
must have followed a different tradition.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_29_XXVIII" id="St_29_XXVIII"></a><a href="#V29_XXVIII">St. XXVIII.</a>) It is Folker's long broadsword that the poet, with a grim
kind of merriment, calls his fiddlestick. We shall soon see the minstrel

<p>(<a name="St_29_XL" id="St_29_XL"></a><a href="#V29_LV">St. XL.</a>) Walter of Spain, <i>Waltharius manu fortis</i>, is the hero here
alluded to. <a href="#St_39_XXI">See note</a> to St. XXI; Thirty-ninth Adventure.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_29_XLVII" id="St_29_XLVII"></a><a href="#V29_XLVII">St. XLVII.</a>) This stanza, and those that follow, come, according to
Lachmann's arrangement, after St. XXXIII, Twenty-eighth Adventure, and
form part of his Seventeenth Lay.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_29_XLVIII" id="St_29_XLVIII"></a><a href="#V29_XLVIII">St. XLVIII.</a>) This allusion to the future is of such a nature as to be
irreconcilable with the notion of separate lays. The like may be said of
many other passages.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_29_LV" id="St_29_LV"></a><a href="#V29_LV">St. LV.</a>) <i>Morat</i> or <i>morass</i>, as far as I can make out from a rather
confused note of von der Hagen's, was a sort of caudle, flavored with
mulberry or cherry juice. Ziemann's recipe is to take old and good wine,
and to mix it with mulberry syrup, rose julep, cinnamon water, and an
<i>ad libitum</i> infusion of simples. All this together composes the sweet
drink in question.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTIETH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_30_XVIII" id="St_30_XVIII"></a><a href="#V30_XVIII">St. XVIII.</a>) So in the Ballad of the Lochmaben Harper in the "Minstrelsy
of the Scottish Border,"</p>

</div></div>

<p>(<a name="St_30_XIX" id="St_30_XIX"></a><a href="#V30_XIX">St. XIX.</a>) "As now," says von der Hagen, "at the entrance of many old
buildings, particularly churches, a tower stands, containing the stairs
which lead directly to the upper story."</p>

<p>(<a name="St_30_XXI" id="St_30_XXI"></a><a href="#V30_XXI">St. XXI.</a>) This stanza, which is only found in the Lassberg and two
other manuscripts, seems to have been inserted, like several others, in
order to soften the ferocious character attributed to Kriemhild in the
latter part of the poem.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-FIRST ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_31_I" id="St_31_I"></a><a href="#V31_I">St. I.</a>) The whole of this Thirty-first Adventure is supposed by
Lachmann to be an addition to the foregoing. His reasons are anything
but conclusive.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_31_X" id="St_31_X"></a><a href="#V31_X">St. X.</a>) According to von der Hagen the shields were high enough for the
bearer to lean upon them, and pointed below, so that they might be
firmly fixed in the ground. They thus, I presume, in some degree
protected the owners, even while the latter were resting.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_31_XII" id="St_31_XII"></a><a href="#V31_XII">St. XII.</a>) The dust was raised by the horses, as the Huns seem to have
ridden from the palace.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_31_XXIII" id="St_31_XXIII"></a><a href="#V31_XXIII">St. XXIII.</a>) "The kings" here, as mostly elsewhere, are the three
Burgundian brothers.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span></p>

<p>(<a name="St_31_LXIII" id="St_31_LXIII"></a><a href="#V31_LXIII">St. LXIII.</a>) Kriemhild here deals with Bl&#339;del as Juno does in the
Iliad with Sleep, and in the Æneid with &#338;olus.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_31_LXXII" id="St_31_LXXII"></a><a href="#V31_LXXII">St. LXXII.</a>) Something seems defective here, for it is not explained
what bad object Kriemhild had in view in sending for her son, though it
so happened that mischief came of it. Von der Hagen and Vollmer mention
the account in the Vilkina Saga, according to which Kriemhild, in order
to set the Huns and Burgundians by the ears, told her son to strike
Hagan in the face, and Hagan returned the compliment by cutting off the
lad's head and throwing it into his mother's lap, but this is
incompatible with the manner in which the fighting begins in our poem,
though this particular stanza seems to refer to something of that sort.
The reviser of the Lassberg manuscript seems to have observed the
difficulty; at least the last line of the stanza is different in that
manuscript. Possibly this stanza may have crept in from a now lost
recension, which more nearly resembled the Vilkina Saga. The like may be
said of St. IV, Thirty-second Adventure, which contains the celebrated
contradiction about the age of Dankwart.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-SECOND ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_32_IV" id="St_32_IV"></a><a href="#V32_IV">St. IV.</a>) This stanza is completely at variance with the earlier parts
of the poem, in which Dankwart is represented as Siegfried's companion
in arms. It is therefore a most efficient ally of those critics who
attribute the poem to two or twenty different bards, and this has
perhaps rather blinded them to its defects. It is quite inconsistent
with the heroic character displayed by Dankwart in this very portion of
the poem, and, as an answer to Bl&#339;del's speech, is a consummate piece
of stupidity. Bl&#339;del had not accused Dankwart of having murdered
Siegfried or offended Kriemhild, but of being the brother of Hagan, who
had done both. Dankwart should either have attempted to show that Hagan,
not himself, was innocent, or that they were not brothers, or he should
have urged the hardship of making one brother suffer for the crimes of
another. Any of these answers would have been to the purpose; not so the
speech which is put into his mouth here. Bl&#339;del, with equal
absurdity, after having already told him that he must die because his
brother Hagan had murdered Siegfried, now replies that he must die
because his <i>kinsmen</i> Gunther and Hagan had done the deed. It appears
probable that here, as elsewhere, a passage has crept in from another
version of the legend, which agreed, more nearly than our poem, with the
Vilkina Saga. I quote the following passage from the summary of that
work in Vollmer's Preface to the "Nibelunge Nôt." "Hogni begged Attila
to give peace to young Giselher, as he was guiltless of Sigurd's death.
Giselher himself said that he was then only five winters old, and slept
in his mother's bed; still he did not wish to live alone after the death
of his brothers." In the Vilkina Saga Hogni, who answers to the Hagan of
our poem, is represented as the <i>brother</i> of the other three kings. It
may appear visionary to speculate on the contents of a poem which may
never have existed, but certainly in any version of the legend, which
represented Hagan as the <i>brother</i> of Gunther and Giselher, Giselher
might naturally have made the speech here put into the mouth of
Dankwart, and have been told in reply that he must die for the crime
that his <i>brothers</i> Gunther and Hagan had committed. The idea of a
recension more nearly allied to the Vilkina Saga than that which we
possess is no notion of mine. It was started years ago by no less a
person than Professor W. Grimm, though not with reference to this
passage of the poem. See his "Deutsche Heldensage," p. 182.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span></p>

<p>(<a name="St_32_VII" id="St_32_VII"></a><a href="#V32_VII">St. VII.</a>) This mention of Nudung's bride, together with what follows in
the next stanza, is quite unintelligible, if we suppose an independent
lay to begin at St. I.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-THIRD ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_33_XXII" id="St_33_XXII"></a><a href="#V33_XXII">St. XXII.</a>) Lachmann seems here with reason to read <i>Volkern</i> for
<i>Giselheren</i>, but have not the two stanzas, XXII and XXIII, changed
places?</p>

<p>(<a name="St_33_XXX" id="St_33_XXX"></a><a href="#V33_XXX">St. XXX.</a>) With this stanza (St. 1916, L.) ends Lachmann's Eighteenth
Lay. I must own that it appears to me quite impossible that any writer
could end a separate poem in this manner. Similar objections may be made
to the conclusion of most of these <i>Lieder</i>.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_33_XXXI" id="St_33_XXXI"></a><a href="#V33_XXXI">St. XXXI.</a>)</p>

<p>(<a name="St_33_XLV" id="St_33_XLV"></a><a href="#V33_XLV">St. XLV.</a>) There certainly seems some confusion here. The only people
who had injured Gunther in Hungary were the Huns who had massacred the
yeomen, and these were not present in the hall. If, on the other hand,
he suspected that the Huns in the hall were privy to it, why allow Etzel
and Kriemhild to depart without so much as an observation? Why, as
Lachmann has observed, does not Dietrich think it necessary even to make
a request in their behalf? It is easy to remove these objections by
declaring everything spurious between St. XXX and St. XII, Thirty-fourth
Adventure, but unfortunately, though St. XXIV, Twenty-eighth Adventure,
which brings Etzel and Kriemhild into the hall, is not admitted into
Lachmann's Lays, it is clear from stanzas XII-XIV, Thirty-third
Adventure (1898-1900 L.), which form part of his Eighteenth Lay, that
both Etzel and Kriemhild were present in the hall when the fighting
began, and indeed Lachmann admits that the plan of his Eighteenth Lay
requires that they should quit it. The composer however of the lay, who
surely ought to know his own plan best, seems to have been of a
different opinion, for, after having set the Huns and Burgundians by the
ears in the hall, and put Dankwart and Volker to keep the door, he has
left us to guess the final result of these serious preliminary
arrangements. The 7,000 Huns massacred here are no doubt the same as the
7,000 who accompanied Kriemhild to church at St. XX, Thirty-first
Adventure, and the same perhaps as the men of Kriemhild mentioned at St.
XX, Thirtieth Adventure. These last had <i>attempted</i> mischief, and
Gunther may here take the will for the deed.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_33_LVIII" id="St_33_LVIII"></a><a href="#V33_LVIII">St. LVIII.</a>) The meaning of this stanza is anything but clear. From the
original, and the two readings <i>von</i> and <i>vor</i>, it would seem doubtful
whether Hagan laments that he sat at a distance from Folker or that he
took precedence of him.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-FOURTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_34_XI" id="St_34_XI"></a><a href="#V34_XI">St. XI.</a>) I must confess I cannot see any inconsistency between the
first line of this stanza and the third of the preceding one; but there
is certainly a discrepancy between the second line, in which both Hagan
and Folker are mentioned as scoffing at Etzel, and the two stanzas
immediately following, which confine the invectives to Hagan.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_34_XII" id="St_34_XII"></a><a href="#V34_XII">St. XII.</a>) Lachmann's Nineteenth Lay begins here and ends with St. V,
Thirty-sixth Adventure. Scarcely any of the whole twenty begin and end
so unappropriated as this.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span></p>

<p>(<a name="St_34_XIX" id="St_34_XIX"></a><a href="#V34_XIX">St. XIX, XX, XXI.</a>) I have arranged these stanzas as Simrock and Beta
have done. Braunfels places them XX, XIX, XXI.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-FIFTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_35_XX" id="St_35_XX"></a><a href="#V35_XX">St. XX.</a>) I have here, without intending it, stumbled on an interior
ryhme, <i>sounded confounded</i>. Still I can assure Professor Lachmann that
the stanza is genuine.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-SIXTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_36_VI" id="St_36_VI"></a><a href="#V36_VI">St. VI.</a>) Here begins Lachmann's Twentieth Lay.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_36_IX" id="St_36_IX"></a><a href="#V36_IX">St. IX.</a>) Here they are described as coming <i>ûz dem hûse</i>, which seems
to contradict Kriemhild's exhortation at St. XX, not to let the
Burgundians come <i>für den sal</i>. Perhaps they here merely come out of the
hall into a vestibule at the top of the staircase, so as to speak with
Etzel and Kriemhild, but not into the open air. So at St. V,
Thirty-ninth Adventure, Gunther and Hagan are said to be outside the
house, but at St. XXV, same Adventure, Hagan rushes down from the
staircase to attack Dietrich. From St. XXVI, Thirty-sixth Adventure, the
staircase seems to have been of no great length.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-SEVENTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_37_XVII" id="St_37_XVII"></a><a href="#V37_XVII">St. XVII.</a>) Compare stanzas CXV, CXVI, Twentieth Adventure.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_37_LIX" id="St_37_LIX"></a><a href="#V37_LIX">St. LIX.</a>) It is odd, that the hall, which must have been the principal
eating-hall in the castle, is here called Kriemhild's. Von der Hagen
thinks Kriemhild had appropriated it by having attempted to set it on
fire, but arson is an odd kind of title. He supposes, too, it may be the
hall mentioned at St. IV, Twenty-ninth Adventure; yet it seems strange
that Etzel should have received his guests anywhere but in his own hall.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_37_XCI" id="St_37_XCI"></a><a href="#V37_XCI">St. XCI.</a>) This stanza, as Professor Lachmann justly observes, cannot
belong to Hagan, but is appropriate to Giselher, who is mentioned
immediately after. Still there is an awkwardness here.</p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-EIGHTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_38_II" id="St_38_II"></a><a href="#V38_II">St. II.</a>) The king himself has come to the feast, has made one of the
party, that is, has been slaughtered with the rest. See Lachmann's note
(St. 2173 L.).</p>

<p>(<a name="St_38_XLIII" id="St_38_XLIII"></a><a href="#V38_XLIII">St. XLIII.</a>) I have with Simrock and Beta followed the reading of the
Lassberg manuscript, <i>struchen</i> for <i>stieben</i>. The latter is explained
by Braunfels and von der Hagen with reference to the flying out of
sparks from armor, but this effect follows in the next line. To an
Englishman the reading <i>stieben</i> appears to bear a comical resemblance
to our vulgar phrase, "dusting a man's jacket."</p>

<p>(<a name="St_38_LXXXIX" id="St_38_LXXXIX"></a><a href="#V38_LXXXIX">St. LXXXIX.</a>) The Amelungers' land was Bern, that is Verona, the
hereditary possession of Dietrich: who was driven from it by his uncle
Ermanrich, Emperor of Rome. He took refuge with Etzel, and remained in
exile 30 or 32 years. For what further relates to him and the Amelungers
<a href="#St_28_IV">see the notes</a> to Sts. IV and V, Twenty-eighth Adventure.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span></p>


<p class="center">THIRTY-NINTH ADVENTURE</p>

<p>(<a name="St_39_V" id="St_39_V"></a><a href="#V39_V">St. V.</a>) The phrase, outside the house, <i>ûzen an dem hûse</i>, appears to
mean merely outside the hall. They seem to have stood in a sort of
vestibule at the top of the stairs that led down into the courtyard.
Compare St. IX, Thirty-sixth Adventure, and the <a href="#St_36_IX">note</a>.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_39_IX" id="St_39_IX"></a><a href="#V39_IX">St. IX.</a>) I have ventured, in conformity with the original, to talk of
"joys lying slain," though certainly the phrase seems harsh in English.
One manuscript reads <i>freunde</i> friends, instead of <i>freuden</i> joys.</p>

<p>(<a name="St_39_XXI" id="St_39_XXI"></a><a href="#V39_XXI">St. XXI.</a>) Walter of Spain ran away with Hildegund from the court of
Etzel, as that monarch himself informs us in an earlier part of this
poem. As the young hero was passing with her through the Vosges or Wask
mountains, he was attacked by Gunther with twelve knights, among whom
was Hagan. The latter however, "for old acquaintance' sake," refused to
fight against Walter, and persevered in his refusal, till the Spaniard
had killed eleven knights, and Gunther himself was in danger. At last,
after all three were wounded, they made up matters. According to the
Vilkina Saga, Walter, after slaying the eleven knights, put Hagan to
flight, and then, having lighted a fire, sat down with Hildegund to dine
on the chine of a wild boar. As he was thus agreeably employed, Hagan
fell upon him by surprise but was pelted so severely by Walter with the
bones of the wild boar, that he escaped with difficulty, and, even as it
was, lost an eye.&mdash;See W. Grimm's "Deutsche Heldensage," p. 91.</p>

<p>The Latin poem "Waltharius," which is translated from a lost German one,
gives a more dignified account of the matter. There also Hagano refuses
to fight at first, and says</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Eventum videam, nec consors sim spoliorum,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dixerat, et collem petiit mox ipse propinquum,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descendensque ab equo consedit, et aspicit illo.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Eleven knights are killed, but next day, after Walter has left a
stronghold, where he could be attacked by only one at a time, he is
assailed on his march by Gunther and Hagan, and the fight continues till
Gunther has lost a foot, Walter his right hand, and Hagan his right eye
and twice three grinders. The combatants are then reconciled. For the
situation of this field of battle, see "<i>Lateinische Gedichte des 10.
und 11. Jahrhunderts</i>" by J. Grimm and Schmeller, p. 123.</p>

followed Gunther into Hungary. These last we may call yeomen, the other,
squires. The <i>edeln burgære</i> (St. XXXV, Seventeenth Adventure), seem to
have been not the mere townsfolk, but the chiefs of the corporation the

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/license">http://www.gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
